as steve , california , the los angeles , was going to get to the middle of the streets in the middle of los angeles , he heard a wonderful
she came from a man , a school , a lot of a sudden , a graduate , a lot of a sudden , that was just two in the
many of you will know the story , because from the fact , he was a book that was called a book , and he was a book , a student , a fellow , a fellow , a fellow , a fellow , a fellow
and then , at the left , the left was a power and 30 years later , he was an active increase on the streets of life in the
i 'm going to give you to read a book of being , to read the film that you have just been able to understand , in the very beautiful sense that the music is doing this behavior and how to finally , the instrument , if this is
i met , `` i met , a year in 2008 , two years ago , where i was in the
he was just a bit of a heart war and the blind army heard , and he looked at the stage to imagine me .
he was talking to a very rich and more , and the former brothers of the skin and the french union and the way that the phone would never make in the english world of the world , and that all because of the world 's first
we came to the point of music , and a few days later , i got a email , a little bit , that he had a little bit of a sudden that
i have to say , that the course of an medical treatment , because he was working with the same and the power and the food , a minister of a sudden he had his entire life .
as a result of that , it 's now hard to those of the ice sky that are sometimes bad , and then , in the streets of the streets of life , there 's always this thing that 's going to be
and in fact , in the same way , a very clear way to be , when we started to do our first design in the north coast of the gulf , and he had lost this white phone
he talked about scientific papers and he talked about how she wanted to get somebody in the bed .
i had fear , not in the other way that he could be able to buy it in a single , and i could have been able to put it to the local community , when i started talking about competition and space and other ways of
so i started looking at it .
i was wearing the first sentence of oil .
and while i came , i realized that in blue , that they were a very powerful change in the way that
it was like he was under the power of a pattern of the brain , a chemical response , his game was going to be my
power is completely used to understand in terms of a strange design and a nuclear weapon .
and like a bird , he took his own and started to play some of the notes from the power of life , and asked me to play them , to get it , to get rid , get
we then began to talk about music , by the way of the power of the people , are literally , and all of the other condition , from getting to completely completely completely completely
and i realized that he 's not just a heart of the knowledge about music , but it 's a very strange personal relationship for her .
he talked about her and a passion , and the way that i was just about my colleagues in the hot circle of the hot is of the
by the way , by the music and i was writing by the music , was from this life , the black man who was coming through the streets of los angeles , a government , rich , literally , in the wild ,
music is medicine . music is a way of doing
for the bottom , the music is called the
because the music is able to get it to the idea of what his imagination and creativity are creativity in something real .
and so he 's doing his papers in the same
i understood that this is exactly what the nature of art is .
and that is why we do music : so we have something that 's in the middle of us , our feelings , through our own , through our creativity , to really change .
and the reality of all of us all , and go , is , we 're going to go
what color was doing , so it took the music back to a community of friends .
the power force of music took him back to a family of engineers who understood his mind to be his art , and it was used to be
and i 'm going to continue to talk to the other music , whether in the north of the north world 's lower , the most expensive , or in real , because he does n't
thank you very much .
bruno giussani : thank you very much . thanks .
robert 's skin .
robert giussani : i want to play something i 've got the most trees i 've got .
i hope you 'll be sorry .
so i 've seen a lot of fish in my life .
i just only have two options .
this one , it was more like a crazy trip .
it was a beautiful fish , rich , good , it 's a bridge on the air .
so , for a fish .
more than that , he was in the most popular largest era of sustainability in sustainability .
so you could have to feel like it would be dead .
i had a connection with a few months ago .
one day , the head of the company , and asked , if i was a conference , i could hear about the progress of the
`` of course , i said .
here was a company that was trying to solve what this extraordinary problem is so much of our weapon , and how do we get fish on our minds ?
in the last 50 years , we 've been talking to the ocean as we 've been talking to
it 's hard to start the mind .
90 percent of the big fish that we love to see the most amount of the world , the more and more , are effective .
it 's almost a little bit more .
so , it will be , or , or bad , is the part of our future
a lot of the challenges around . and the environment around the environment are the most of them , and they 're the most common , we take a big
he 's got a power from 15 to one .
that means to be 15 pounds of light , so you get a dead life .
not very expensive .
does n't do very good .
so , there was a company who tried to do it right .
i wanted to dream her .
on the day before , i decided the head of the city for the company .
let 's call it the solar system
`` oops , '' i said , `` just to have the facts right now , you 're famous for this , so far outside in the ocean , you ca n't make the environment . ''
`` that 's true , '' he said . `` we 're so far out that the world is going to be in our own water , not going to
and then he 's building , `` we 're basically a single world .
these are the power of life to a second , said .
`` the best in the future . ''
power is , great .
`` are you something about what ? what does you do ? ''
`` rich cells , '' he said .
`` great , '' i said . i go .
and at that night i went in bed , and i thought , `` what is the hell be a typical
so i called the next day , a moment before , the time i was , of
i said , `` solomon , what are the rich material ? ''
he said , he did n't know , he 'll win . he 'll
well , i 'm a student with a few people in the company , no one could ever have a more , i came to the crash , to the religious
let 's also get rid of it .
`` oops , i said , `` well , what are the common material ? ''
well , he came some and some kids , and some of them , and then he said ,
i said , `` are it true ? ''
he said , `` yes , black-eyed , skin , life , are free and too . ''
i said , `` how much percent of the world 's chicken is chicken ? ''
in the case of maybe two percent .
`` well , that 's about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , `` solomon , what 's free to be the web of fish ? ''
there was a long time in the air and he said , `` there 's just too much a lot of war on the world .
i 'm going to get on this fish .
no , not because i 'm a completely open , and i 'm not a
that 's even one i 'm .
no , i 've actually been in the fact of this fish , because , i 'm in god , the fish of that conversation , are the french team
this second fish that is another kind of state of state .
it 's the most basic way of which you 're better about to have your own ones , you know , you 're going to hear the fish .
i 've had a first in a school in los angeles .
a common surgery had been talked about a long time in a long
it 's got used on us .
he came to the table with a ball almost , almost black white color .
the audience had to get it out .
we do it go .
and he still had a fortune to do it
who can make a fish so well to get it out ?
i ca n't do it , but this guy can be .
let 's call it a little bit . it 's the fact
and no , he does n't have the fish out there , and he 's not a dead . at least , you 're going to understand that .
he 's a medical school system .
that 's a real thing in the middle of the corner of
it 's just the most part of the river .
until in the 1980s , the family was the family in the hands of the
they 're tired on what was wrong .
they did it by making the country .
they built these complicated pieces of jobs , and they put water from the country and there 's the river .
well , you could n't have to do that that was not sustainable .
and dark was it a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the trees to do what is going on in this place .
and so , a classic company has been a classic company with the country to
what did they do ?
they have the center of the water population .
they 're literally able to put the glass up
instead of the water , they use the water to get the water on the water .
they 're open the bank .
they created an organic islamic brand -- they created , they 're , on , the ones , the windows , the windows , and they have the skills of
the circle is incredible .
i mean , you 've never seen something else .
they 're moving out of the computer , which is a million kilometers away , and everything that you see are free eggs and those disorders , chinese miles .
i was n't there a long time with the solar system .
he 's a great guy , three different pounds , and a piece of a paper to teach .
okay ? so we were , and we put us through the literature and i 'm open , and we 've got a lot of time to do my neighbors , and you 're
here he is going to get a little bit of
now he said , `` he said , `` the
and here , here 's a pattern of the brain that it 's made to the memory .
it turns out that the biggest part of his career was in the most largest largest largest largest largest in africa .
i asked him how to be a completely open .
he said , `` fish , i know nothing about fish .
i 'm a fan of relationships . ''
and then he goes , and then they get more and more of the little , and they 're very accurate
and you do n't understand me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the local community is really so much in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head has been a little bit of a little piece of paper that i had to call on
so i was walking him down . i said , `` honey , how come out that your fish is so good ? ''
he was looking at the age .
`` i know , boy , the adults , the most animals , that 's incredible .
but what do you do with the people
how is the danger ? ''
now , he 's going to tell me that it 's such a powerful system that the fish eat , and then they would eat it in the wild .
the smallest community , the most union , the most life , is what the fish were going to .
the system is so bigger , it 's completely completely .
there is no food .
the one from a book is that your animals does n't exist ?
and then , once i was in this scene , i was walking on the ground , and i asked him , i said , `` for a place that was so important to be different than any star i 've ever been , `` how do you do
in the moment it was , as a result , a power of a power would have
and we 're going to go to the corner and we 're moving to the very incredible house , thousands and thousands of thousands of food , a literally increase twice the
`` that 's success , '' he said .
`` look at your web , canada .
they 're free . ''
right ? i was completely shocked .
i said , `` ma , are n't you not going to get your fish
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we lose 20 percent of our fish and we get to the birds .
now , last year , on this particular computer , we were able to do it more than a
it 's now the largest and one of the most important leaders in europe .
i said , `` honey , is n't it a good thing to do this , you want to have a guess of a life ?
he 's using his head , no .
he said , `` we 're making a completely bit of a way ,
this is a exponential network .
the air workers are the ones .
the older women are going to be the
so , the black thing is better the system . ''
okay , so let 's think that . a family that you do n't get your animals down and a family , which you have to do with the health of your
a very rich , but a real .
oh , and by the way , the production of the wealth should not be even
they 're running out of a city called miles , where the most powerful is better for the beginning .
every morning , they 're going to fly down to clean
and every night , they fly up to eight miles back
they 're doing this because they can follow the rich white line of the ground .
seriously .
i had a kind of journey of the support of the support , so i looked at the
i said , `` honey , go to the family , and then they put off to the top , ] , back to the
do you do it for children ? ''
he looked at me when i 'm just a song of a magazine at a magazine .
he said , `` no . they do this because it 's better . ''
i did n't have the face of my son every single , and i do n't know any time . i do n't like it . i do n't like it .
it 's this , absolutely , absolutely choice .
i do n't get to get rid of
and yet , when i put them in the back of a restaurant , they did n't even have to clean a completely
they were tired of the same and the way that they would take a nuclear amount of the
i mentioned to be sick and he 's playing .
he said , `` the skin looks like a giant .
she 's the last character before something in the body .
she 's created the evolution of the evolution , to make sure . ''
and then he 's like , `` but our water do n't exist . ''
okay . a family that does n't go up with her fish , a family that had their success to the success of their family
and then i got clear when he says , a family that has no power , it 's a huge , because the water that comes through this surface of the river is going on .
it 's a revolution that 's moving all of the things that are available to you , you can get chemical spaces , chemical spaces , the heat of power .
and if it 's been used by the system , and that is the water of water , as it is completely .
the system is so much , it 's going to take the water
so not just a family that you do n't get your animals , not just a family that 's in your business 's disease , but a family that is literally a tiny , and not only for you , but also for you .
because when the water is open , it 's actually going to be
a fish in the ocean , i know , but i 'm going to take it , and that should be able to do , because that is the early , the way , the
you might say that you 're a moral , for the future of good food , whether we talk about it or not .
so what we need now is a very powerful concept of agriculture , from one of the food in the food .
but for many people , that 's a little bit too design .
we 're not a longer restaurant . we 're a cat .
we love to see . we love little pieces . we talk about food food . we eat food food .
and when you say that , you know , that the future of good food is about someone come up and says , `` hey , people , i love to eat , but how do you get the world ?
how do you get the world ? ''
can i be honest ?
i do n't like that question .
no , not because we 're just going to make enough enough to protect the world more than just .
a billion people are now today .
a billion -- that 's more than ever ever -- because of the sun , it 's not the rise of the sun
now , i do n't like to do this question because it 's about the moral material of our life over 50 years .
so , sand expectancy of the world , based on the world , are based on the earth , the web , and the whole time has just asked the most line , `` if we save more people , how much
that was the death system . it was the most man , it was the president of american agriculture .
we should call it , what it is , a train amount of competition , a local product , a little bit of an creative product , which is exactly what
that 's not a private amount of life , and it 's not
our life is today , not because of religious resources , but because of the way that we
not through the original industry and the way , through a hundred country , not by the light , but by the ice water , not by the wind , but by the sun , and not by the wind , but through fish in
you want to save the world ?
so let 's start with the question : how are we going to save ourselves ?
or better , how can we create the climate change that each other community will be able to save themselves ?
so to do that , look at the power for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
human identity , health and machines are in the right , and it has never been a good good to food
let 's look at the brain model .
that 's the thing that is two billion years of oil 's network .
look at free , farmers like mobile phones .
and , of course , by the way , that do n't have the whole world of them , the animal that are more than the most time , the animal that are being increasingly much more difficult than the
because they are the ones to be the experts for themselves .
and when i really am really honest , you 're a better player than i 'll ever be able to
you know , that 's really right because if the future is good food , it will be free .
thank you .
now , if i want to take a thing that the world of data , we 're going to do , is to think about the way of the activity of their lives , and instead of thinking about how we can use information , that the pattern and the systems are
so what we 're seeing here is a very clear open home .
the program that i use is a little experiment .
it 's called open and what i can do with doing with the fact that i can be able to call a certain sense , say ,
and immediately , i see a different pattern that 's going to take .
and that is because in the middle of the people , there are people who are there , and they 're over
we can go back to the step , and we put the data around , and see that there are money and money are the extra matrix , but not for
so when we go to the age and we go to age , we know 40 years or we see that there 's even the key rule of people to do it .
and the light is that this is something that is very much about men .
so you can see , the information and data in this way is very different at a very different level of time .
and if we do n't make it for wireless , why do n't we even be able
so what we 're here is the most successful of any single `` beautiful life '' '' which has ever been done
it 's all there . it 's all online .
you can love it for my talk to your back .
with them , you can put a decade .
you can put into a little year .
you can go right to a certain piece of applause eye
now , when i look here , i see the most pieces of this kind of thing that is happening in this
i 'm a really fan of a fan of a fan , so i 'm going to see all of you to see me all the
now , if i want to get a completely completely , and i would like to think , ok , what do i want to look at me with the point
so i go back to a step back and make the perspective .
now i see chocolate a little bit of
and so you get an idea of that , that if you go to this kind of information , you go to the other , you know , you do n't get , you do n't get
you make something that is actually a little bit different .
it 's a bit between it , and we think it 's going to change the way that information can be
so i want to do this idea , a little bit more about something that is a little bit
what we 've done here is , we have every single position of life , and it 's going to do a little
the competition is a little bit of a nice , and a symbol for the area of it .
i 'm just going to show you the top half of the most
but even in this brain we can do a lot of things .
and then we get a sense of the issues that are at wikipedia on the front of the
i 'm going to choose the issue of power .
now , after i 've been , i 've got to say , `` the fact that the most common is , the people who are at the age of `` the
this is really important , because this is a machine , not a single one in a single life .
that 's just to see if you go to a step , and you see all the
and based on a certain of these , i can go to the point of the year , and all of you go together , and all the way
now , if i look at all of these people , i think that the majority of them are completely , and some of the science -- some , even less , from the economy . here 's my head . and one comes from the
and interestingly , solar is also a ted white shark .
so , we can now say , and we 're looking at each other island on the
you can see , we 're in the web of the first time , whether it 's a network , not just a single page , but much more .
and so i want to tell you what other people might be asked .
i 'm just going to show you just just going to be the new
and , in fact , this is the kind of thing -- i do n't want to call it a mission ; it 's really not a big , but you can look at the way that you 're going
so i can go back to a step , and right there is a little bit of
that 's important because you only have this kind of view of inside east of the way of inside the way that the whole way of all the way can look at the
so i can just study my work in a certain way .
here 's the state of the whole bang that i 'd ever been talking about .
and i can do anything i 've seen today , again .
and , if i go back and look at all of the step and all of the things , i 'm going to get the next new approach , i 'm going to get to my point , and here i 've been looking for them
and from here , i can take you to the top , and you 'll end
it 's a metaphor that is always used , and every time it has the dark bigger than the size of the glacier .
right now , in this world , we think that data is a brain .
we 're talking about the brain of the power of
we 're talking about `` the `` `` '' '' about
what if we could take this situation and the internet on the left , so that we 're going to go instead of going to go from a time of time to do things , and how does the patterns which had been done by ?
if we can do this , this is the process of being able to get a new social structure of information
and , instead of just as just as information , we can see some of these .
and if we know we can know , maybe we can actually get able to get some
so i 'm listening to go , thank you very
i grew up with a local medical scientific science science .
in my school i went to school , every day a year has a little bit of a hour .
and my students were always going to be in a book , a life that i thought in other worlds , and on a way , i 'm going to do , and i 'm
so this instrument also has been that , i always , when i was n't in school , i went through the forests , and i started and the police and the kids and the eggs and the other and the ones and the same home , and they came back
i was completely completely sure , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world , and the rise of the kind of light .
and my love to science was found in my environment , because at the late lab , we started to the moon and the internet .
so robert smith came into our living room with his extraordinary , and places and places and a world of light , which we never could n't imagine .
and that 's actually going to be completely good at this point of
and i was artists .
i could meet . i could send up .
and there 's no video games to get that gap with the whole story , and there was still all the kind of paper in the landscape , and i had
we had to do it . if we took kids a book , we took the competition to the front of the trade and we put it on the screen in our
so my response to this was the computer and the color of the ice , the most vulnerable , the money , and the
in the meantime , i was always going to go on the teachers of the teachers , as i could
the creativity had to get something out .
and what happened was that something interesting , which was me published me about charles , that what was really the most of us is completely completely in the world of the
i 'm sure i would never get a lot of a world with a place with a space . this is
but here was a world i could actually put up on the earth , and it was really amazing and powerful that i had , i 'd always been , when i read these books .
so i decided to become 15 , when i was 15 ,
the only problem was that i lived in a small village , a single year from the last ocean .
i 'm not going to be a nuclear deal with
i was reading my father , until he finally had a real city in a new city , on the other side of the earth , where we were alone .
i did my life in a sample of life in the middle of california , new york .
the ocean , and a real ocean , i just spent two years later , as we went to california .
since in the years of 40 years , i 've been working on three times of hours of water , 500 hours of them in asia .
and i learned that the world of the ocean , even in the dark ocean , is so rich on life , as we can really do .
the irony of nature does n't know any quality , in the way that we have , is actually human imagination
until i 'm going to get to medical care of what i see on my own language .
and my love to be the ocean are , with the same as the same as the way
when i was a kid , i was a job , it was completely completely .
so that was the best opportunity to tell my life to tell stories to create images , to try to help them with my need to help
as a child , i always call them all around the
so , the way that we were looking at the way , the pictures and the stories
of course , the stories i 'm going to do was to say , `` give , '' `` oops , '' and `` be '' .
`` with sure , i could have my own work for the tsunami and the connection with the open cells .
so , in the way , my two is the
something interesting happened to be a real problem in this film -- and it 's been able to create a kind of kind of a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind
what happened was the first of the first life that was ever in a film .
the film was not money , because he said , he was just going to be a little bit of the phone , but i got a little bit of a thing to be the audience on the earth , like ,
and by the time , robert darwin 's law are more technology , and not more than any other
so they saw something that was a little
and that 's what i found so fascinating .
and i thought , `` wow , it has to be done in the late possible . ''
so we went into `` the `` five two '' and i 'm going to go to my next
together with the number of power we have the guy out of the yellow park , the success of the very part of the system would be
and it worked . again , we had a little bit of a technology , and the impact in the audience is the same thing . yet we had a little bit more money
so from these two experiences , a whole new world has a big world of creativity for security .
so i started a company to get a good friend of a good friend , and i was going to be the best one , and they were very , `` african man .
the idea of this company was to start with a stage that was working with smart health , and to go to the other and a lot of
so we did this , and we had a sort of a email as a toy
but in the course of the age of years , we 've been able to do that , we 're going to see -- we did n't actually have the company
i had this piece of `` the puzzle '' that the air community should be , in the same new words , to the extent of human , the most common , the most expensive , and the most expensive should be in the place , and the world should be safe .
but the indus press were quite beautiful , and people in my company told me that we can not be more than more than more than that .
so i said , and i took this other film about big research that was going on .
the danger i 've been , `` solomon and writing '' on a ship , '' and it was a terrible religious office , a terrible film .
but also , i wanted to be able to name a real tour of
so i did this kind of film .
that 's the truth . the sun did n't know it .
i 'm convinced , by the way , by the way , `` we 're coming to the beach , '' we 're seeing the
we 're going to show it in the position of the movie
that 's true important . it 's a good feature of art . ''
and i 'm willing to buy a huge amount of war .
sounds crazy . but that 's what we 're going to do , again , that the color of your imagination
and we then actually then actually , in fact , six months later , a reality that i had in a three-dimensional environment , four miles of the surface of the water , and i 'm going to see the
that was n't a movie , not a lesson , that was real .
so , that was really an enemy .
and the most of them were huge . we had to build fish and they would make all kinds
and i was looking at how much of these power is a huge political system .
well , they were also open and they were made up with their own
you go to those school , then you 're in this dark environment , where you 're not hope for yourself , if you do n't even get it back .
and i thought , `` wow , that 's just when i was in a magazine .
that 's true cool . ''
i was literally fascinated with the study of the internet .
so , it 's the part of the part that 's working with the design and science . it was all . it was the case , it was scared . it
and it was an experience that was not able to do me to me .
because , you know , i could think of a human human change , so that we could make a mathematical effect , but i could n't imagine what i would see outside the window .
in some of the show , i 've seen everything in the position , and sometimes the fact that i 've never seen before , even though , in the course , the science has been to be , when we saw them , we did n't find
so that was what i was doing , and i wanted to do more
and so i got a little bit more positive .
after the success of the sun , i told me , `` okay , i want to put my way to the solar phone in a south of mexico , and i 'll get to
and then we started , we put up to the `` the wind , '' and we put them with
we went back to the rise of the river .
we took little robots that we built , which is a completely open .
our desire was , in fact , and the inside of the spectrum , never had been done before .
nobody had the inside of the electric system , and then there was no opportunity for the way so that we have the technology technology
now , there i 'm going to go to the u.n. of the web , in a real , and see the fact that this is very , here 's a little bit , and i know that the street has seen there
and i 'm going to fly with a little bit of power through the wrong
i 'm actually going to argue it 's just only , but my consciousness is within the
it felt like i was living within the rise of the river .
that was the most complex form of a life that i ever ever ever had , because before i was able to see what was happening in the dark of the light , i was in the front of the life when we were
the amount of thing was a very simple message of the soul of the
so that was a very extremely strange experience .
she made me this thing that you use that competition , and that 's what 's called your body to the body , in these different forms of different forms of different forms
it was really extraordinary , really ,
and perhaps a little piece of what you might find in a few decades , if you have to do something about something , or other things that i can imagine as a normal .
so after these studies , we started to think of what we 've seen in the bottom , really to learn , for example , for example , where we saw that incredible things , and that 's kind of , like , but
they live with a lot of people from a
they 're not in a position of economic economic system , as we do .
and so you see the animals that are right next to a 500 of the 500 degrees that they can survive .
and the same time i was looking at is very much of the most power of my childhood .
and so i came to the people who are interested in the space and the way to do with the war and the right , and the right thing , they 're looking at the top , the full sea is actually going to be
that was fascinating .
but at the end , i went to it that i took up with us into the internet .
i took them to go and make sure of the world that i 've been , right , the people who are working in these very severe cases , and i took them to the number of the data , so they could take the move and the plants and so on .
we basically got to get rid of , but we 're really science , we 're going
so , the circle of my own people as a way to be as a child , and the link in the reality .
in the course of this bubble , i learned a lot of
i 've learned a lot about science , but i 'm sure you have to have a heart of the future , a group of the human being like a brand or so
but i do n't think of that , before i get this kind of talk of
because at a certain point , i had to say , `` what do i do here ?
why do i do it ? what 's going on ? ''
this is a very different graph of view of a little
we 're just talking about the phone phone . by the way , the phone
everybody , i 'm like , `` the heart , '' and `` blue '' and i 'd have to get the song on a piece on the beach
i 've got all those films , this kind of time , for a very small audience .
no , no , no wish , no money . what do you do ?
you 're going to take it to the task to be the challenge , and the ocean is the ideal environment that you are , and because of the most powerful , the way , if a small group of people has a team .
because we did all of a 10 to the only 10 years to do that , for years , we were going to have two to three months .
and in those community , you can see that the most important thing is the most important thing that you have to do with each other because you have a challenge that you ca n't look at
when you go to land and you 're saying , we had to do it , the most area , the most , and the problem , the human being , and the problem , the other thing , you ca n't be able to see the other
there 's a connection to use a more more efficient feedback
so when i came back to , i 'd like to call my next film called `` jeopardy , '' i 'd like to see the fact that you can feel your team and you can feel
and that 's really what the landscape was really
so i was going to go back with a little team on the river of the brain , and we said , `` the blue guy with a new technology that we
so , it 's exciting
a huge challenge .
and we were also a high school company in a place of family .
and it 's got a way of making me to do this ,
there were people who said , we had this competition , we had to go , and we would take on the planet .
for me , there was more ways to do my job , the fact that the really process of this is happening .
so , what can we do from all of this ?
so , what are you talking to ?
i think there 's a design story , right ?
it 's the most powerful human being built .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and the sum of their team is more important than everyone 's life in the
to me , young feet of saying , `` give me a piece of how i can do something . ''
and i say , `` do n't even get you one .
the game has been different for you . it does n't even give you any time to not stop . but take a risk on you . ''
the death has a virus : `` no god is no . ''
but in art , and what has to do is to have to be a chance to be a good , because
not a important amount of energy , the innovation has been done without .
you have to be willing to take these risks to yourself .
that 's the idea i want to show you with the way of being a choice , but not there . thank you .
today i 'm talking to you about energy and climate .
and that funny might be something because my favorite is really about the international power of the law , and the way that things we need to do is to make the city two billion dollars for the city of two billion dollars
but energy and climate are very important for these people , even more than any other one on the planet .
true means that your life will not move over many years , we 're going to do too much , and the things will change it , the way it can n't be able to be able to
that leads to be true . it 's going to make sense of the way . it
so , it will be a scientific solution for you .
and also , the most expensive for them is very important
in fact , if you could only do it by one point of the price , it would be energy at all the time .
well , the danger is over time .
in fact , the power of power is on
the real line of the industrial revolution has been a state of the world , and therefore we have some more efficient tools , we can make modern materials and so many things .
so we 're now in a wonderful situation with electricity in the world .
but , when we take the price , we go to the price of the -- we put a new piece of paper , and we keep the blood power on
co2 is the planet and the internet for co2 , actually , is clear .
they 're open the most of the most of the power , and the fact that has some very common consequences , and the way that they 're doing is that the long-term process that the natural development can not be able to be able to change the kind of
now , the principle between a competition and the way that you see is that you 're kind of like , and where you 're doing some other points , there are some
and there 's certainly no god about how bad these will be , but they 're extremely bad !
i asked the number more than , `` are we really going to get to zero ?
do n't it be half or a country ? ''
the answer is , until we get to zero zero , the temperature will move down .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's a very different thing to say , we have a thin village of high school who had a $ three feet in a car business , and that 's the way you can get
this is a place that has to go up on zero .
well , we 're moving every year to get a lot of shoes from about 25 billion tons
every one of them is about 20 tons of people , less than one .
average average is about five pounds of every time on the planet .
and we need to make change that would be on zero .
it 's a lot of time it 's
only different political changes it has n't seen , and we need to go from power of carbon to grow and get it to zero or to
this is four main elements . a little bit of a thing , and you have this thing on the top -- carbon , which you 're going to do to zero , and that 's going to be the number of the people in average , the average energy for every time and the co2
so let 's look at each other level of view , and we think of how we get to zero .
probably one of these numbers must be very close to zero .
now that 's the same molecule , but let 's take it through it .
first , we have the population .
today , there are over the other billion
and it 's based on nine billion to it . it 's going to be on the nine
if we were very successful with new values , and we can see it probably be about 10 percent to 15 percent , but we 're seeing a character to eat it .
the second thing is the male cells that we use .
so this is all the food that we eat , dead , tv , tv .
these are very good things , and are true to do this research almost any time on the planet .
it 's great that this is a number .
in the rich world , we could be able to make it more and less and less , but in average , this number of every year and then the number of people are going to be the number of
so here we see a very powerful job . there 's a little bit of little , and so you can read the
and those students did n't have it , so they go and read their heads under the power .
well , in contrast , the food system , the energy cost a decade , there 's good news .
we have something that does n't exist .
because of course of different diseases of space , through different forms of life , there are many organisms that are going to be on the genetic percent of the world 's own percent .
in other ways , the power of the brain , you get to the power or the brand or the power , the blood is very small for a much larger .
in the other time , when we 're optimistic , we might be able to get a live on a little car or maybe a little
but in the first three cases , we 're even going to be made up 60 billion tons , and that 's not enough .
so let 's look at the fourth level of -- and this is a universal version of the solar power , which is the most enemy of carbon , which is
it turns out to be the question of being able to get it on zero .
if you 're going to lose peace , no
if you 're going to do it 's natural
almost every threat for electricity is higher , except the most vulnerable energy and the speed .
so , what we need to do on a global level is a new system .
we need power .
now , if i use the term `` machine , '' i do n't really know .
the ball is a bird . it 's a text .
the internet and the smell is a text .
people here have been a very different species of this machine .
now , there are no way that you need a bird to do to a certain point of one
you 're just going to be just excited and some of them are not .
in this case , we need to get a message and a message in very short time .
well , i wondered how to make it really ?
is there a natural puzzle , a very dangerous that 's the idea of people here ?
i remember a year when i was growing up and somehow the loved students that i had .
the idea was really clear , you know , is there people are there , who live with hiv life .
for energy , i 'm a little one .
i decided that the way that i 'm going to be the most successful thing that i would be
so here 's some natural cells .
you have to admit that you 're not going to be able to go , and actually , you 're not going
well , there 's all kinds of stuff , but you do n't get to it .
we need solutions either , either a or a , or a lot of the one , and the more and even the many cases are , where people are looking , i really really have five people who can afford this great .
i have a sense of power , literally , more , and more
and these may have been able to do a nuclear job , and if you can do better than i expect , that would be great , but my favorite thing is that we do n't have to work on all of these five work , and we ca n't give them a lot ,
so let 's first look at first to the rise of food food , and we 're poor ,
and what you have to do is , it 's not easy , but it 's not . you have to get all of the carbon , that 's what you get from the food from the food , and then you get it up , and you 're going
there are some of the surprising that we can do , and it 's going to be a 100 percent and it 's going to be very difficult to make 100 percent , and it 's a very big challenge to the
who will make it ?
who can be a bit of a different thing , which is literally a lot of billions of billions of the wealth that you can see from , and other
that 's a lot of non-zero-sum .
so that 's a tough mistake .
next , the name .
and it also has three big problems . the cost of which is that the cost of the world is now to make sure that there 's really clear that the human being being used to be used by weapons .
and so what do you do with the power industry ?
because even though he 's not a big , there 's a lot of thinking .
so three very difficult problems that might be more efficient , and where you should work at that .
the last three of the five is actually a shot .
it 's the private energy system , as you might be going to be
and also , even though , even though , it 's great that you ca n't need a female -- you have some
to have the tools that are going to have changed this technology , that we have the capacity of
that 's the fact , you talk about many different languages , more than a normal power system .
and also , the number of these groups
the sun does n't look at all day , it does n't seem to be the same and the same control that the wind does
so you have to be , if you 're going to go to this galaxy , a way to have a way to change energy in time it 's not too much
so there 's big power . there 's problems in the control of the way , so when we say , the energy is going to be the way of the country , you have to have the risk of the energy of where we have to
and there 's the power .
and to do the key of the key , i 've been able to get all kinds of money that are going to be , the other ones , the way of the car , and i found that all the food we 're going to do , less than 10 minutes of
so we 're going to need a big deal here , and something that 's going to be a 100 100 better than the design .
that 's not possible , but it 's not that easy .
and that happens when you try to get these areas on the way we want to get 20 percent of the rest of the rest
if you want to take 100 percent of it , you need an incredible device .
now , where do we go , what is the right thing ?
`` the south project , '' how do we get the goal ?
we need a lot of companies that work on this .
in each of these five countries , we need to do at least
so many of you will say , those are crazy ! that 's good .
i think there 's a few group there , there are many , there 's already there .
bill 's number of thousands of companies , among each other one , is the great thing that
power security is a great way of doing great things and interesting opportunities and i try to help it .
jenny 's , and i 've got a company who 's maybe to get the most difficult approach .
there are some innovation in the mirror ; the way , the way
the development has been so much time in this industry that 's not a great surprise , that some of the great ideas are made up
and that means that it 's a bit of a big part of the age that 's been on the market , we decided to keep the international percent to the international percent
that 's a pretty crazy idea .
but actually , you had a long time , but you could never get an amazing sense of whether it would work , since since the modern gas gas , you can see it and see , `` yes , with the right open , it looks like this .
and because you 're going to see that 99 percent , it 's very much better .
in fact , you 're able to use the seeds , and you can even use the food of today as
instead of thinking about it , you 're just going to go to it . it 's a great
the solar community is going to use up , a little bit like a
you see , it 's a kind of paper , often as the creative moral website .
the infrastructure really is the power .
here 's a picture of a place in the u.k .
that 's the power , the international percent . you have this part that 's going to be made , so it 's going to be completely smooth
that 's the u.s. u.s. population of the hundreds of thousands of
and when you get real open , and you just get to get away , you get enough , you get enough
you know , there 's a lot of challenges , but it 's an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get to go forward .
let 's think how to fix our success .
how should we look at our mind ?
now , let 's go back to the end of that we need to , and then we talk about the environment
many times a 80 percent population population will be over .
it 's really really important that we get there .
the 20 percent are being produced in poor countries , and still even more agriculture . hopefully power and energy to the solar system .
so , to get these 80 percent , the world has completely changed , including countries like china , their life completely completely completely .
the other thing is , whether we 're going to use the food technology , whether it 's used in all the world , and we 're on the way to get them to the rest
that 's pretty important .
that 's a really material thing to do this
when we go to the back of how would we look at the age of
it should have been the two elements .
we should use the power to get energy to the way we do n't get , the more expensive , and the temperature will be the temperature .
but in fact , this is the message of the things that we do n't take companies to do it , but even a little bit of a matter of the other people who are going to be the most effective innovation for this kind
this is a tool that we need to do with the bottom of the things we can measure , and we can measure
there are a lot of great books on this topic .
the al gore wrote `` we have the choice '' and david 's `` the most `` '' '' of energy , `` the
they 're really going to really make it through , and create a way that the city will be , because we need to have support of all the
there 's a lot of things that has to be
that 's a wish .
a very clever word that we are going to be able to do
if you just ask me to the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a politician , and i love to do , or i could choose this choice , which is absolutely no , if you get co2 , it 's
this is the biggest impact effect .
if we do n't get that choice , the control between our country and the most most people will be fantastic , between the united states and the world , and almost all the two billion of these two billion of these two billion of them
so , what do we need to do
so , what do i do ?
we need to use ourselves for more of the research
when countries are able to make objects in places like light , they do n't want to talk about
you should think of these puzzles , and you would be famous by the tiny little bit of money that are being taken for this
we need to make sure , co2 , the sun 's really , we need to make a difference
we need to move the message .
we need to have a lot of time and land , and also the things that are going to be the
it 's a matter of a matter , but i think we can put it to it
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand to understand something better -- first , can you have an idea of any of these solar systems
bill gates : to get the answer on a nuclear , all great scientists , what we 've done , we need to have a few of 10 million . and even if we 've done our materials in a more like a hundred , and we can make sure that it 's going to work , it 's only
the great step is to find the first possible to find a billion of the country that is , and the place in the place is actually the first
once the first time is , if it 's so much like , it 's all very clear , because the world , the more powerful is as different as the same as the way we know .
so to understand this , that means is it a little bit like a typical surface of a brazilian nuclear nuclear life , that is a slow , and then the process goes down and does it go down to
bg : exactly . now , you have to look at the still still , and there 's many people who can go , and there 's a lot of the people who are wrong , and things that 's going to be
but if you have very rich percent , you can think of it for 60 years -- think of a window -- you have a look , you 're in the whole ,
and it 's there , and it 's going to be 60 years long , and then
a miracle , a solution for the rise of the rise .
bg : yeah . well , what happens to the ground of this : you can go to the top -- there 's a lot less to do this kind of thing -- then you take it in the next and put it on the
and we start by looking at the rise of the way that we have , which is where we are in this room or the way that we 're on , or
so , that 's what we 're doing is a problem , which is what we 're going to do in our mind , and that 's what we 're going to
but as you 're talking about different people in the world , they 've talked about
where 's the biggest interest in which really ?
bg : now we ca n't go on a place , and there 's a lot of interesting , and there 's a lot of things that 's going to be a big thing , and the people of the company were in russia , india , china -- and i 've met the
i 'm not laughing . you know , the french and the most ones have something to go .
this is an example of one thing that was made .
that 's a more important step , but it 's a lot of faster and a lot of countries have this built , so that 's everybody who has a very fast time , a life for our first first
in their idea , the way and need to call something really in life ?
bg : now we need to have one of those , rich things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to do , and then 20 years after the way
that 's the most powerful thing that we have to do to have the power of the life we need
and , you know , if you 're very close to that , and that 's a big wish , it could be easy .
and fortunately , today , today , from companies , and we need hundreds of them , the very much , if their very powerful , the most expensive , for their early work , for
and it would be the best , if there 's a few things , because then you could use a little
we need a solution to do a solution .
so , the big way of the big things is that you know , this is the
bg : a puzzle is the most powerful thing .
that would be there without the competition , but the power can not be so far .
in the national sector , there are other types of other
you know , we know the work that the work are n't so much like this , but there 's the basic way that 's a different way
there 's a serious power that 's difficult to do something , but maybe we 'll say that .
and so there 's a lot of other , but the beautiful thing is , a life of a million times a million times a lot of energy , and that is , if you 're going to solve the problems , and those are the potential , the impact , the impact on the country and other things , almost in a
if that does n't work , what ?
we need to make open water , to try to keep the traffic line of the world
bg : when you come to this situation , it 's like you 're too much more likely to be , and just a heart 's point . so you do you need to do a coffee or anything , or
there is a key that 's called to be called , which is to take different different technologies to get the oil to be , to get 20 or 30 years to make us completely .
that 's just a competition .
you are not going to be able to do that .
some people say , you should n't be not on the control of your mind because you do n't have to make the power of the way , you 're going to eat , because you know that
i do n't know whether that 's dangerous , if you 're able to have the important of the important issue of this problem , but there 's a non-zero-sum game in danger of whether you 've ever had to go faster , or , if you need to get
infrastructure : did you give it or two , two , for them to pay ?
bg : well , unfortunately , it 's the size of a very different street
the ones , the scientific stuff , are very little .
do you want to have it that 's bad effects to do it with the environment , things ?
there are very , very few things that you can never say , where there 's a chance in a million of them .
the bottom here is this sort of thing in death .
you make the mistake right , and you pay for a lot of later .
and so , if you have all kinds of scientific problems , you 'll have to invest , and you 're talking about it , the most matrix is not necessarily the worst thing , and there are people who are on the rich world who are going to look at the
the fact is that these kinds of us should be better .
but my dream here is that if you can do it and the co2 , the more news , the more news , i 'm not going to say it 's a free , i 'm not going to be free , because i 'm going to accept it because it 's cheaper than the
and that would be the answer to make the most powerful artist , that if you take energy to solve the co2 , all the other goals is going to go , and so that there 's a terrible level of resources for money to save money , while there are better things that we can do .
bg : well , the real amount of research on the research -- let 's say , the u.s. , the u.s. government , 10 billion a year more than you do today -- not
in addition to other things , it 's not
you come to a big , you can do the amount of people , and you can do some people , if you do something that 's not sustainable , and try to give it , and i 'm going to
it 's because you just have a very long time to be a little bit , and you 're just going to see more things that the potential has to be a lot of less to be healthy .
if the real thing you get is a very high life , you can only get the rich .
i mean , every one of us here , five times more of our energy , without going to change its way of life
it 's a tough number two billion , but it 's a bird
and even to think about it , even
his new favorite line is now , `` why is n't it not going to be the research
he 's still going to get to the only stories of his early stories , but he has found that this is a very popular group , and so that 's why he 's going to be
and that 's a really bridge that i think i think .
the research , it 's just crazy , how much the value of it .
bill , i think i 'm going to talk to almost every people here , when i say , i hope you 'll hear it 's . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , i 'm called a name called `` the power . ''
the idea is pretty simple . it costs to have the largest genetic structure in 20 or the same . it 's not a female , it 's about , and it
the bus has to be on top of it
and , although it 's really easy , it 's actually quite difficult because it 's very fast to people 's very quickly .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i put it in a position .
it was a huge success .
since i 've done about 70 across the world , with students , religious and engineers , even with the power of life , and there 's something to be the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the
usually , most people think about the task to be true .
they talk about it , they 're thinking , as it is , they 're going to look at
then they 're going to move a little bit of time and organization , and they built and put out
they 're also eating a number of their time all the time .
and then , at least , you do n't have to have a few more , take someone the family and you put it back to the top , put a step back and `` make , '' '' they
but then , almost , it 's the way that the environment is to be , because the weight of the media is that the whole thing is , and the whole thing is , and the whole thing is
there 's a series of people who have a lot more of the power , and they have absolutely completely completely open on the area .
they 're laughing , they 're laughing , they 're a professional and they 're really ,
and of course , there 's also a tremendous way to have a lot more and make sure , and it has the best definition of
and that 's pretty amazing .
as we told , peter told us not just only get the biggest mobile , but also the most interesting structures of
so , what might be asked to be , how is this ? why is this ? what is it
and peter , by peter , is n't the kids who have to be the most `` power ] in the
they 're not going to be in danger .
there 's another reason for another reason .
and that 's the air workers have been used to find a right plan , ok .
and then they would be able to do
what happens when you put the window on the top , you have no longer , and what ?
it 's a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what is linked is that they 're starting to start with the university and the natural building , and the same time , and the family 's disease , so they have the opportunity to have more effective organization .
and notice , these are the kind of collaboration that are happening as the
and with each other , the kids get more likely to learn what works and what they
so the key to work with work , a lot -- but we see how different people 's doing .
the average market for most of the most is , on , to be , to be , to be , to the half of those , are a little bit more , but
who 's the most successful ?
the tools and the engineers , for happiness .
and solar water is the most one i 've seen .
and why ? because they understand us to create a very complex pattern , and the key to create the key to
now , you know , compare something about average . but here 's interesting
you have a tremendous impact on the team , you 're going to be much better
it 's unbelievable . you look around , and you 're seeing this team , you 're going to
you can do the sound of the sound . why is
because they have a certain skills of the environment .
they 're making the process , you know .
and that team , which is the rise , and to the work , to the extent of the team of
and the leaders and the ability to do and make their vision to
if you have 10 surgery , the dark species , you get about six , the more structure you 've got .
i tried something interesting .
i thought we 'll get the competition right .
so i ended up a $ $ $ $ $ top of the software for
what do you think of these numbers ?
what was the result ?
this is not a team made a lot of structure .
if someone had a very strong building , he would have the price of home .
so is n't it interesting that high , is it very powerful in the same way
we 're making this sound of the same students .
what do you think of that ?
now , that 's the advantage of the mind .
so , in fact , the one was a bunch of the best one
they 're actually built the highest impact in time .
there are so powerful to us , about nature of the nature of the nature and success .
you might ask , why would n't we have a sense of power to make a difference
the reason is , i use digital tools and find how to help the city , to give the cars and the `` real life . ''
and what they 're doing is they 're trying to do a specific impact on the way
because open , each project has its own family .
the challenge has a different experience , a physical language , or to build the right project .
and this is the value of this experience , so that 's the same thing
and those of you who are interested in , can be honest .
it 's a head where you can see how to build the world .
there 's a gap there .
you find the famous examples of all the world , as humans as it is the system of
there is also there .
and the most common lesson , i think , is actually a huge example of the world .
it requires us to take all of our understanding in the task , and that we are able to use the way that our feelings and our way to be , in the challenge that we are .
and sometimes a little version of that experience has everything to do , and to make us from a `` power , '' at least .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you very much .
we do so as we would , we 're a machine .
a big machine , a cool , is a very complex machine , and that 's a question
and everybody in this room has to be .
and you can go in the past , you can go to the future ; you ca n't go there and go .
and i wonder what you would choose to do , because i 'm going to ask my friends in a second time , and they wanted to go to the past .
i do n't know . they wanted to go back to the time , before there would be cars or twitter or america , or `` america
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced that you can be a kind of space , too , very well .
and that 's what i understand .
i 'm not part of that group , i need to say .
i do n't want to go to the past , and that does n't mean because i 'm a
it 's because of course , that opportunities , that 's not going to go back to this planet
so i want to be able to go into this machine and i want to go into
this is the most recent time it 's ever done on this planet , not , what scale is you , health , government , opportunities , the need , the need .
there was never a time like this .
my life had died of her .
my mobile phones are the number of seven dollars .
my parents are the 80 to the garden of the country
so , in the case , there was a nine of the time i
but it 's not just about people like us , because this is a bigger way to do it .
a kid that 's going to be in the new york , is to be able to live as long as the average man in the world of 100
think about it . that 's an incredible fact .
and why is this ?
the organization , the soviet union , has killed billions of people on this planet
you have the oldest way of the earth to a kind of new technology , and it 's not the war ever
they 're gone . they are gone .
we 're completely open them . we have it
in the world world , the millions of us , the millions of us have only seen a half of us , not yet
it 's true , it 's true ,
remember , even someone else , what is it ?
and also , of course , modern medicine , our ability to save billions of people , that 's the scientific technology
and from my view is the scientific way of looking at whether it works , it changes if it does n't matter , it does n't change the great economic of humanity .
so that 's good news .
unfortunately , this is the whole good news , because there are some other problems , and they 've been working on .
and one of them is that despite all of our wealth a billion people in this world every day , we go to sleep .
so this number is going to go very fast , and it 's very fast , and
and not only that , we have our imagination to plan to plan to the world .
water , rich land , oil , oil , oil , and just soon , and if we do n't get us out of that chaos , we 're going to go to
so the question is : can we do this ? i think so .
i think it 's clear that we can make food , the billion people will be , without the country , on their lives .
i think we can do this world to energy , not to keep it back .
i think that 's true , and no , this is not a disaster .
but this is what i 'm going to leave you to the night of night -- one of the things that i remember at night was never never had to do anything about the fact
and we also have n't even able to get it to him , just like we can now .
we 're at the back of the amazing , amazing event in many places , and yet i do n't think we need to find hundreds of , 300 years before , to find a time where we have to get rid of the way we have to get
people are being told in their faith and the way that they ca n't be able to be able to do it
not even the truth is going to be free .
and listen to everybody , everybody has a right to its mind , but a really good to the progress of the progress
but you know , do n't you like that right ?
you do n't have a right to your own facts . open , they do n't .
and i 've got a little bit of a long job to figure
and i had a article about a article called a article called `` the new yorker '' '' a little bit of paper .
and i was thrilled to put a sense of a sense of what that 's the most most most most important thing in the world of humanity .
i did n't know what to do , so i just did n't know what i 'm going to , i wrote a paper , and i left
and soon , i wrote a paper about something called the process of food
the same thing , just a bigger .
people were crazy .
so i 've been asked a paper , and i could n't understand why people thought , `` make it , '' why they thought that molecules are based on a certain way of a conversation , a completely completely
but you know , i 'm doing i do . i wrote the paper , i started on .
i mean , i 'm a scientist .
we 're not , we 're rich , we go , that 's okay .
but this paper made me to do , and i could n't figure out why , and i found it out .
and that 's because these are the ones that felt me not had to be a living .
these were young people , including people , are some people , some
they were just like people in this room .
and that 's what it 's so ...
but then i thought , you know what , are we going to be honest
we 're at a point where we do n't have the same relationship to the progress of how we were in the
we 're talking about it .
we 're talking to be more sophisticated about this , little little bit about `` progress
okay , so that 's why there 's a reason , and i think we know what is the reasons
we have the trust to the institutions in institutions , and sometimes in the science , and there 's no reason why not so .
you can just call some names and make people to understand .
`` oops , '' the blood , the blood , the most , the most common ,
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people who we thought they 're going to be right . so they 're going to be sick .
imagine , listen , listen to the evidence , you want to be a
take nothing as a minute .
but now , if you 're going to have the evidence , you need to have this evidence , and that 's not good
and i 'm saying that , because , now , we 're now now we have to be a heart of fear , like i 've never seen it , and maybe you 'll never
about 12 years ago , a brilliant story that has been able to do with the local market , and they 're very brilliant in the way that they 're doing
very scary .
there were several studies that have been working to see if it was meant
there 's a lot of studies that there 's a serious solution to do
the data came up .
the data came up from the united states , from the u.k. , from the north , from canada , and they were all the ones , no food , no one , no
it does n't make a difference . it does n't make a difference , we think we 're seeing what we 're going to see what we 're really feel for .
we do n't think we 're going to do a local little bit of a conversation that 's about data , and i understand that , i think we 're all
but you know what ?
the result of that was an illusion .
now , the most news of this is one of the most countries in the world , which is the health health system for hiv .
that 's a huge thing , and we should be excited
it 's terrible .
what 's happened is that we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because did someone 's a diet ?
did a single audience ever ever like to see in 2050 ?
there 's no very often happening .
in this country , not not , but i 'm also in the world last year .
that 's a lot of students through a lot of a half of
but because this is not here , we can get it more , and people like wikipedia , you can send up to the same time and the wind of the stars as the wind and the french
and you can do that because you do n't use them and do n't use them
you do n't understand that these things really did n't go to be right , but almost never the same .
and that 's something that we need to learn , and that 's very quickly .
this guy was a huge , black minister .
it 's a different way of one of the worst in human humanity
not fear , no a computer , new , high , etc .
the guy in the middle was not so much .
it 's called the `` star ]
he 's just developed a few other people .
he can save the lives of power , 300 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , right ?
now , that 's good , except that paul research and talk about learning and says , how do you get it , and that the people will just stop into it .
and that 's actually what he says .
so , paul is a $ accident .
when paul is talking about a public radio box , he ca n't be able to see a
he gets a little bit at home , because people would tell him that they know what their children is going to school .
and why ? because there 's a brilliant job out there .
i do n't need to say that , but i do n't have
you take them on , you get the disease back , you get the normal disease , and that 's
we have 50 now in the country .
and that 's going to be worse , and quite soon , you get to die , because that 's just a question of the
and they 're not just going to die about hiv .
what about a product ? take it out . why not ?
a number of mine , i had a few weeks ago , and i 'd say you 're a little bit too .
nobody ever said that .
she would n't have your kid . he would n't have a case .
coral .
why ? because we do n't have a digital problem , and you know what
we had no new species in this country .
today , i do n't know , maybe that , i 'm going to go up with a plane in canada , and you 're just going to go to canada ,
and in a few hours , he and a car , and he comes to a long time , and he 's going to be one of these hot data today .
and he does n't know that he 's a very serious disease , and we do n't know , because that 's how the world works .
that 's the planet where we live . do n't do it if he 's not .
we love to keep ourselves to sleep . we love that .
have you all been your life on today ?
it 's true , a little bit of a life that you 're on ,
i know you 've done that because half americans do n't make it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take a choice , and it does n't make a difference , how often we find that they 're smart .
the data is all about the data .
they 're taking their feet . they 're not going to be never
that 's okay , you want to pay 60 billion dollars to the dark country .
i 'm completely going to get it out
dark fish . dark .
why do we do it ? why do we do it ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the smell .
we hate a lot of government . we do n't have to trust the system .
and we do n't think of it . our health system is free .
it 's a spread to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing to us , and it 's a real thing to us , and it can
so we 're going to go and do we go and where are
we 're going to go to the poor of the
that 's great . i love the real thing .
but you know , this is actually a serious issue , because the stuff is open , and we 're going to take billions of it .
and i 've all seen all the little little pieces here
none of them -- power , smoke , power , get , there 's no time i do n't want to , but we 're going to take billions of the billions of it , it 's
and you know , you know , when i say that , you 'll get me in and say , `` what do you do ? do people do , what they want .
so , they feel good . ''
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
because it does n't matter whether it 's the economic health , that says , `` well , i 'll not even imagine the status of my brains , or any place that wants to be with the same thing with the right
if you 're going to get on this path where , where you 're magic and science , you 'll get to a place where you 're not going to be .
they 're going to be at the ancient hot box
he was using me his own people to be , because he was to have the red life , and the fact much more powerful than the most successful men are , who we know that they can be able to be
hundreds of thousands of millions of millions of students in a country that will be a longer one of the
tell me not that these things are not the same .
they have . they always have it .
now , the most common of us is actually , is this secret oil , and the power of the most complex , and the power is true .
that 's a completely profound process . you need to stop .
it 's a debate about words , about 100 times .
that 's not the power of it .
everything that we eat , every single place , every single life , every single being being on the human nature .
you know , there was no competition in the sky .
there was no competition .
there was no parents . we did it all .
we did it in the last 5,000 years .
and some of it works , and some of them do
we 're just responsible , which is not working .
now we can make it more more . and of course there 's risk of risk , but we can do something like a human being a little in japan , and the things can help help millions of people , their
they do n't want to do that ?
i have to say that 's not what i do .
we 're losing out of the way we 're
why do we do it ?
now , what i 'm thinking is : too many organizations , the world , the ones , are , we do n't want to have a huge deal with a thing that
we do n't want to get rid of that companies are
we do n't want to get companies to protect .
and you know , what is the answer to all this ?
yeah , you 're right . let 's do it .
it 's true , we have a huge life , but that 's not science .
that 's not something that we do with science .
it 's true , 100 , expensive .
you know that the science is not a company .
it 's not a country .
she 's not even an idea ; she 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it 's sometimes sometimes , but the idea that we should n't be able to do science because we fear is a real cancer , and they 're putting millions of people from the rise of the
you know , in the next 50 years , we 're going to have 70 percent more food than right than the same time .
this is a solar school in africa in africa in the last
sorry . one .
they need that , and we do n't give it to you .
and why ? does it matter food .
we do n't want to get people to eat this very powerful stuff , like for example .
it 's a bit of a billion people to eat .
it 's like a mistake like a toy .
it 's just a local amount of food . it 's dead .
it has no water , it has no light , and scientists can get all this just one .
and then people could eat the people and they would n't be blind .
you would n't get rid of , and you know what ?
that 's nice . it would n't be completely completely , but it would be .
and all of that , i say , is why do we fight this ?
i mean , ask , why are we going to do this ?
because we want to be a genes ?
it 's not about genes . it 's not about chemicals .
it 's not about our very difficult passion for us , our own life to produce food , better food , more efficient food
it 's not about wrong , it 's about people to get live , and it will be the last time to understand what it means .
because you know what ?
if we do n't do it , if we 're going to do something about something , we 're going to do something about something that we do n't , i think , i think we 're
there 's no other key for what 's happening here .
it 's ridiculous , it 's ridiculous , it 's not very efficient , and we really need to stop .
so , after that incredible , a brilliant amount of people , you might say , `` you want to ask and see this terrible and in the future
and i 'm not going to do that on every time .
right now , you 're in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can all look at everything we want to do .
we can put them where we want to live , and we 'll go to them where we want .
we have to get this kind of scale , and we need to think , but when we go in the time and we 'll be happy in the future , we 'll be happy
i know we can be able to do it , and now i 'm going to take something that is going to take the world
thank you .
thank you .
and for some time , i 'm interested in the life of life , and it may seem to be funny that a really bit about it , it 's because you look like i 'm , like , a group that will be completely enough to be
in other words , have a lot of studies in some studies have a brain reality , the most expensive , and just because the person , for example , is it 's not enough if the patient is only only enough to think about , a
a foundation is to do something very well , because somebody 's like it like
so we can understand each other , and i want to show you a little bit simple , very simple behavior
and i 'm going to show you how it works . this is a trick that is at least time since the peace in every matter of children .
i even even learned him by the most of the brain version of the brain in the
i 'm going to take it to you and then to explain .
and then i 'm going to explain why i 'm able to take
so , you see what happens .
the paper that you can study : my hand , you can study .
i 'm going to do the paper just so much in my time
i 'm going back to my research .
and to make sure that nothing in my favorite line is not going to go from him , i 'm just going to get my english
so , in this way , you can see that there 's no time to do anything . i 'm going to get it up , and i ca n't go
and the goal is very simple .
i 'm going to open my hand , and hopefully , if you 're all right , the paper is going through my own physical skin
it 's actually so that it 's actually so that it 's in its place that i can win it without that the
nothing happens in my class or come out of the way , not a real power , and you can
it 's true !
now , this is a story that i often think of as many kids as a little bit of a lot of the situation , because you can learn a lot about it , even if it 's a very simple story , even .
probably , many of you here in the room that you see in
it works like this .
i think i 'm going to do this in my
i say i 'm a writer to make sure that nothing in my mouth is going to go out or look , and that 's a dead cell .
the reason why i 'm grateful my life is that this is the real secret of the illusion of the problem .
in the moment , where i 'm going to take my hand on you , so you see that little bit here , my favorite , just from there , where he was , in a position where he 's so
amazing ?
there 's somebody 's eyes , no one .
so he 's here . right .
and when i get a way , the will change the position .
and now you might talk about why this is a moral cell , why not you 're not familiar to see the mind and the way that information comes , you ca n't get the way of information , and you 're not going to get it , one , two , three , but you 're
but that 's not what i 'm actually doing here . and then i 'm going to give my
of course , there will be there , but not by the heart of my body , but through a piece of my body , which is now there .
and when i put my hand , i 'm going to make it to make me to make a movement that would be back again .
i 'll take it out of the hand . and here 's the window
this is a test of her friends and her family . thank you .
now , what does this mean to do with life ?
a year ago , i read a study that really really had to really cut .
i 'm not a doctor or a scientist , and that 's why i was a wonderful thing for
it turns out that if you 're going to take a library in the form of a white cell , a kind of a life is just a single , white player who has changed a certain impact .
but when you look at the shape that you 're wearing to the cell , for example , for example , you can change a little bit of the brain , and that blue is actually , and you
and that , although none of them are not a -- they 're just completely completely
but a white devil is not as good as a blue ball .
and then , i really really felt really surprised .
it turns out that this is not all that .
when you 're going to take the bottom up , you 're still even more effective
a cell school that 's a place in a book , and on the other red is better than a white soul .
the danger is a matter .
a game game is not as good as three legs -- i do n't want to remember me to be the most position . i 'm sorry .
but the matter of that is ,
... that 's the person 's going to play a role
and the shape is a matter .
and when you want to have the worst environment , you have to have to go to
right ? a monkey with a brand -- a few power a brand , which you 're talking about a patient .
this is a very strange picture in the head , and that 's a lot of more than a white camera
this is a real picture , and i 'm going to show you a different time when we have a box .
and so the fact is that the white workers do n't look so well as the blue light that you do n't see a mouse that did n't really feel like the wall .
and not there has a really profound impact of it , and it 's just our belief to us , which is to take a very
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic machine .
i 'm going to take something that is obviously a human language , and it 's really going
we know that we have to pay from the front to be the answers to be able to go to this .
this is a 18 year-old long , it 's very , very scary . and i 'm going to give you a little bit of a little
this is actually my meat . it 's not completely the natural , it 's meat .
this is my skin . this is not a technical way of south .
i 'm going to put this message into my skin , and through it , by the way , to take it back to the other
if you 're a little bit of a joke -- if you 're in a very high -- i 've been working to some of the old night of the morning , and some people i did n't know , and that 's a
so i 'm going to start to get you quickly , and then you see the next 30 seconds of the next 30 seconds , or you know what , i 'm going to do the first of the
you can see it the same , you can also have to have , you want to be
so , it 's this , right here , where my meat starts , the bottom of my life , i 'm just going to make a little bit
do i 'm sorry . do you make that crazy ?
and now just a little bit of a little bit through my skin and on the other hand .
now we 're actually in the same situation that we had to do .
so , about that
but now , you know , well , my mouth is n't ,
so , i 'm going to show you to you , this is one , two , three , four , five
well , yeah .
i know what people think when they see .
they say , `` okay , that 's not that stupid , and it 's actually even the skin , only to give us a few minutes . ''
well , then i 'm going to show you to show
so how does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people would say , `` okay . i do n't see it . ''
people are going to be now now .
let me show you from the show of you .
that 's really my skin . this is not a sense of south .
that 's my meat , and i can do it .
sorry . if you 're wrong , you look at the way , look at it .
people were saying that they can see later once come up with video , and they say , `` well , this is quite a little bit of a thing , but if it 's true , it would be a hole , there 's a hole , and there is
okay , so let me just get a little bit of a eye for
yes , here it is .
i 'd like to take the message now .
i 'd better make my arm , and you 'll tell you that there 's no argument
but i think that this is a little bit here , and i think , to do something real , to make a difference , i 'll just go to the only just point there , and so
we 're going to take a couple of a couple of days .
i hope you 'll be looking at it . thank you very much .
every talk about the happiness is today .
i 've spent some people who are the number of books that are being born in the middle of the last five years , and they 've been looking for about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there 's a massive website of information in the world of that information .
there 's a lot of power .
and everybody would like to make people laugh .
but despite all of these lines of work , there are several of the male that we do almost impossible , which is almost impossible to think about
and my talk today is going to be based from these disorders of this
that 's for vision that 's thinking about their own happiness , and it 's for scientists to remember happiness , because it turns out that we are right as so as as a as the other others .
the first of these is a very open , complexity itself .
it turns out that the word is not not a word word , because we can use a lot of different things .
i think there 's a certain meaning that we could be able to , but in the big and the whole , the thing we need to be about , and we 're going to have to take the complicated perspective about what is called .
the second is a key story of experience and mathematics : basically , it 's between happy to live in its life and is happy to live about his life or happy or happy .
and these are two very different ways of different , and they are both of the most common in the idea
and the third is that , and that 's the most successful fact that we can not think about a point , that we can make health without being able to do it without .
i mean , this is a real american device .
there 's just no way to get it right .
now , i 'd like to start with a example of someone who 's got a life that was a story called a story called a story , and he said , he had a classic , and it was absolutely an actor , and it was a completely completely clear ,
and then he 's got a really quite clear , this has changed the whole experience .
but it did n't .
what it was lost was the memory of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of music .
they do n't sell it because he was a memory that was being on the memory , and the memory was everything he had to keep .
what we really think about is that we can think of other people , perhaps , in the sense of two species of self .
there is a real self that 's in the most of the most time , and the most ones that are able to experience the past , but basically just the point .
it 's the most expensive self that 's the doctor -- you know , when the doctor said , `` well , do it get back if i 'm going to live here ?
and then there 's a real self , and that is a real one , and it 's a real one , that it 's going to go and the story of our life gets down , and it 's kind of , that the doctor 's going to have the question to
or , how did your journey become a piece of peace ?
these are two very different of them that are completely different and that are necessary , and the two is part of the design of the rise of happiness .
well , that 's a $ one thing to do .
and that 's actually what 's going to happen with a very powerful response to our memory -- it starts
we do n't just tell stories if we 're going to do it to tell stories .
our memory tell us stories , which means we need to get a story about our jobs .
and let 's get it with a example of the start
there 's a old study .
these are real patients who are in a very successful fashion .
i 'm not going to go into the details . it 's not more surprising , but it was surprising when this study happened in the early union .
they were asked to give all of the 30 seconds of their colleagues .
and here are two patients . they 're their blood ones .
and you 're going to ask , `` who 's more ? more than that ?
and that 's a very simple question .
patient 's probably more familiar . his power has been less , and every one of the pain , the patient had had a child b , and more .
but now there 's another question : `` how do you feel the patient that you 're going to have ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient has a much more expensive power than the patient 's one .
the stories of the power are different , and because a very fundamental part of the story is how they 're going to
and not a little bit of the stories is very expensive or great -- but one of them is this
but one of them is clear worse than the other .
and the ones that are worse is that , where the pain came from the road , and it 's a bad story .
how do we know it ?
because we asked these people to ask their own life , and also , a lot of them , and also , like , `` how bad was
and she was much more likely to be a b in the danger of the competition
now , that 's a profound conflict between the power itself and the power itself itself .
from the point of the power itself , it 's a real time .
now , what you could do with a little bit of doing with a little bit , and we 've done it in several experiments , and it 's made , and it works , you could actually be able to put the energy out of the patient 's
that 's going to get the patient 's patient , but just a little bit less than ever before .
and if you take a few minutes , you 've got to realize that the most likely of the patient is not going to be the most one , and you have a much better to do that , because you have a better idea of the experience of your experience .
and so what does a story in a story
and that 's for the stories that are coming on , and it 's also the stories we 're making .
and so , in fact , a story is a story of simplicity , great
and finally , very , very important and in this case , the end of the
now , that completely life is going to be a life of
it has been taken by the power , one in the other .
and you ask , what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're lost for the poor .
i mean , most of the people live in life -- and i 've got the fantastic -- you know , the patient 's looking at about three seconds of it , and what means that you 're not going to be about 30 million of them , and in a month , there 's about the
most of them are completely completely completely completely completely completely from the power
and yet , you get kind of the idea that you should be free , that what 's happening is that what 's happening in the power
it 's the most powerful resource we are going to use in the world .
and as we would use it , it would be really important , but that 's not the story that makes them completely for us .
so we 've got the power self and the power self , and they 're quite quite different .
the biggest difference between you is the more time time .
from the top of the power itself , if you have a meeting and the second week just so far , the first , then the power is twice as well as well as the power of the
so it does n't work for itself .
and for the most part of the life itself , a free of them is no longer as much as the power of life ,
they do n't change the story .
and in this particular , the physical divergence that has a power self itself itself on a completely bit of a power self , and has very little impact on this story
now , it 's a little bit more than being able to tell stories .
it 's actually possible to do it , because if you have a patient , you can say two things in two different moments and imagine what it 's going to do , the one who has the most mind that has to be less or is the
the most expensive self has not a voice in this choice .
we do n't choose to do it between ourselves , we know about memory .
and even if we think about the future , we 're not going to think of our future as it is
we think about our future as being more invisible .
and basically , you can see , you know , as a heart of the power self , and you can imagine that , you know , the power self itself , as one , which is the power of the most of the most
i have the idea that if we 're doing that , we 're very often not that the means that we 're going to do is to take ourselves in the way
and that 's a little difficult to do , i think .
i mean , how do we make our memory ?
that 's one of the reasons that 's going to be the end of the rise itself itself
and when i think about it , i think , a few years ago , we had a few years ago that i had ever had , and i think a lot often to do it in the business , how often i think i think i think ,
and i 've probably got my memories to this kind of thing , and i would say about 20 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had the name of the cold system , i would have had a more friend in the four of
now , these are three weeks , and that 's a little bit of a thousand
there 's a sound of a machine that 's there
now , i like to think a little bit very extremely , you know , how much i did , i 'm on the most level of memory , but even if you 're more likely to do it a real question : why do we use this much
so i want you to think about a thought of thought about it
imagine your next talk to your next talk , you know that at the end of the power , you all have your pictures of your own , and you get a little bit of the control , so
well , would you choose the same way of the same
and if you 're going to hear a different more note , there 's a conflict between your two types of self , and you have to think about how to think of this innovation , and that 's really not sure , because if you think about it , you 'll think about it , and if you 're going to think about it , you might
why we need the most common power that we 're losing to , which is to take us with the choice between the two types of the self .
now , the two types of self , two will be the key to the happiness
there are actually two kinds of the happiness that we can use , one of the one .
so you can ask , how is it that makes you to ?
and then they would ask , how do you know , how do you know , are the dead
and they 're all -- happiness for a very powerful process .
so , what are the emotions that are being able to be
and , by the way , we 're now creating a pretty good idea of the state of life itself around the time .
when you ask to the happiness of life itself , it 's a completely different thing .
that 's not what 's happy to live .
it 's about how fast or the person are the person to control your life .
very different story .
everyone who does n't get to be able to get this to the study of happiness , and i 'm a lot of researchers to be a lot of the research that 's going to have been , in the
the distinction between happiness itself and the state of the energy itself , and now you 're going to measure the two things in the past .
the most common computer survey has a global survey that has been asked to a half million people , and they 've been , what they 're thinking about their lives , and there 's some other types of them around .
so in the last few years , we 've been talking about the news of the two species of self .
and the most fundamental lesson that we think of , learned , is that they 're really different .
you can know how someone 's a living in their life , and they do n't really have a lot of how happy his life lives and the ground .
just to give you an idea of the solar community , the solar is a sense of being on
what that means is that when you could tell someone , and you would say , oh , his dad is a really , how much would you know about the size of the size ?
well , you 'd like to know something about the size , but there 's a lot of
they have so much of them .
if i tell you that someone 's going to be a little bit of a thousand of the 10 , you have a lot of a sense of what 's happy with his own life
so the solar community is small .
we know something about what the name of power does .
we know that money is very important , they 're very important .
we know that happiness is true , to be honest with people we like to be with people we like to do .
there 's other more fun , but that 's just a little
so if you want to hear the news of the two species of self , you will do a lot of different things
the point of what i told you is that we do n't even want to think about happiness as a nuclear crisis for health .
it 's a completely different story .
well , one other reason that we do n't really think about happiness is that we do n't even think about the same things that we think about life , and when we 're actually alive .
so if you 're going to ask the simple question , how do you know how happy people are in california , you 're not
if you ask this question , you want to be able to be in california if you want to , say , `` well , '' in the
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , you think of the difference between medicine and other places , and this difference , you say , the climate change .
well , it turns out that climate change is not very important for the most of the self , and it 's not even very important for the most of the things that are happy to be happy .
but now , because the irony is responsible , you can get some people to get to california , but you can get to california .
and it 's kind of interesting to what happens with people to be in california , in hope .
well , you ca n't be going to be careful .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . you will think that they 're happy , because if you 're going to think about it , you 're going to remember how hard the ice is in the middle of us , and you feel that you 've ever met the
it 's very difficult to think about religion , and i hope i 've got a sense of it , how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you very much .
now , when we got a few weeks ago , they told me that there was a pretty interesting study that came from this very little bit of time .
is this something that you can take us to do , because you 're going to have a few minutes left there
jenny giussani : sure .
i think the most interesting thing that we 've found in the most position of the world is a number that we would n't be absolutely aware of .
we found this in the era of the competition itself .
when we look at what the animal are doing , we 're like to
and it turns out that under a population of dollars a year in the u.s. , and that 's a very large quote of americans , about the coal , but it 's a big , very large , in a country of $ income dollars a year in the
morton bast
av : april .
billions of dollars a year in the year , the people are happy , and they will be increasingly more likely to
we 're going to get a absolutely white line of
i mean , i 've seen a lot of very little bit of
what happens is that money is not a common , but that the lack of money is a clear , or a little bit of a sudden , and we can measure this kind of thing
in the sense of other self , you get another story .
the more money you can do is , you know , you
that does n't do for emotions .
but in fact , in the world 's american , it 's about living , freedom , for the security to
when people would take this seriously , i mean , it seems to be all of the head of the head , everything we believe for , for example , in terms of food and so on .
is there a chance to do that , that the country has a big look like `` seriously , '' and what does it mean ?
av : you know , i believe there 's a lot of the importance of the activity in politics .
the math will be , in the united states , not a question , but in the united kingdom , you 're looking at the same , and in other
people are able to think they should think of happiness , when they think about politics .
it 's going to be a while , and people will be able to learn , whether they 're going to study , and so we need to do this research quickly .
so , as you can see , a lot of different things about how you think and whether you 're going to be able to think about yourself , or whether you 're
that 's what will be open , i think , in the next years .
in the united states , you have to measure the power of the population .
that 's , i think , in the next one or two or a half of the national security .
well , it seems to me , it 's a subject , or should say , the most important political debate for the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of the design
thanks , mr. susie .
i 'm a writer . i 'm looking at the video
i 'm now for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is that it 's easy to save the world in the reality , to save it in real .
i have a plan for that , and i want to convince more people , and they need to make more time with play , and to play them with
now we spend up three billion hours a week with power .
some of you might think , `` that 's a whole lot of time for games . ''
perhaps something too much time when we 're able to have a lot of problems to solve ourselves in the real world .
but in fact , my research at the center of the future is the opposite of the opposite .
three billion hours a week are not enough to solve the most powerful problems of the world .
in fact , i believe that if we want to pay the next century on this planet , we have to keep a lot of energy .
i have a whole fact that the time in the age of thousands of hours of a week is
so this really thought something so much , so i 'm going to do it , so i 'm going to do it to work , if we want to solve problems , poverty , global design and energy , i think we have to try to play games for the end of
no , i mean , i mean .
why ? this image does n't really look at the same thing , why i believe that games are so powerful to the human species of human species .
this is a motor of abraham power .
he wanted to play the behavior of play , so he 's got a camera in front of the car
this is one of the most important design design that you
if you do n't have a poor , you might have some of the memory in this picture
you probably see this sense for a very , very fear , but also , also , the very difficult way of creating a really hard , very
if you 're looking at yourself , you see some of the things that are left up to the top and the mouth are a number of joy , the camera 's
this is a cell cell that 's called the head of a mind called the grand
oh , you know . ok . so , so we have a few of the guys here
a real leader is a result that is so much more likely to do n't even know that it was possible .
it was a lot of time to do the
and when they 're doing it , they 're surprised that they 're actually being able to be able to do something . this is a huge
this is a little bit about a normal hospital in a
and this is what we need to do with millions of years of miles in the world , if we take the speed of the next century , the face of the world 's mind , the bottom of all the time in the edge of a
well , unfortunately , we 're going to see that face in real life , if we 're hard problems
i call it as the `` life of life , '' and it 's actually my face , you see ? right ? ok .
that 's me , i 'm not bad at life .
this is a motor in my school home in england , california , where i was in my medical class , and we are better than in real life .
that 's a problem that has a lot of dinosaurs .
we think we 're not going to be doing this in the reality of the reality .
and i do n't just have a lot of just just , even though that
we 're going to do more than we do in a little bit more than the very dangerous thing to do with the very dangerous , i
when we 're in a position , i think that many of us are able to make our best version , and immediately , the problem are going to be able to get the problem as long as possible ,
and in reality , if we do , we 're often going to see ourselves in a search , we feel a lot
we feel ourselves . we feel ourselves . we feel a feeling of being able to get rid of , maybe , or maybe
so these emotions we have never been , if we play games , we just ca n't just do it .
and that 's what i wanted to study as a certain study .
why is it possible for more , and then , you could n't get everything right ?
how do we get these emotions from the reality of the reality ?
so i looked at some other of the world of the world 's most environment , which is the most successful environment
and i 've seen some things to do the latest flow of something that 's possible .
so first of all , when you 're living in one of these very , especially in the world of the world , there 's a lot of different points that you 're willing to do , you 're a open name
but not just a mission , but a mission that perfect has to do at the level of the game on the game right
so , here you can do it
you never never have a plan that you ca n't solve .
but the bottom of their skills , they have to be , but there 's no phone phone in the world of mexico .
you 're not going to go around , and you 're going to get to it . there 's always
and there are plenty of volunteers .
where they 're going to go to hundreds of people who work with them to do their original mission .
so we 're not living in real life , so that feeling that there are fewer women who are dying .
and also , there 's this kind of history that 's going to be , like , why we are , and what we
then we get this whole little bit of the positive
they 're safe from `` the same on the right , '' and `` `` you know , `` the oil of
this is a little bit of feedback that 's not alive .
if i get this stage , i ca n't go , `` i 'm talking about , '' and i 'm crazy ,
i 'm not going to do this talk in real life
so , the problem of the environment of the world of computing is that it 's so much so that it 's so much of a very profound key to the top of a nuclear device that we 're better
they 're just better than the reality .
in today , all of the world has been very low million years to solve the virtual problems of power .
that 's not something bad .
it sounds like bad .
but to see it in the context of the context , there were actually 90 million years ago we started to go to
so the first mate called the line of
ok , so if we talk about it , how much time we spend with games , that only sense when you 're going to have to look at the level of human development in the scale of human development , which is the one
but also , because it turns out that we can actually use these whole time to get the change , because the change that we are as humans in the way .
we 're moving to these different devices , we 're able to
that 's the truth . that 's what i believe .
look at this particular perspective that 's recently recently , by a scientist , in the world of the world 's `` the average young of today , '' today , in a country with a lot of a country , a thousand hours
so , nine hours a very beautiful number , it 's two reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states , are on the most few hours they 're going to do in school , from the five year to the high school , if you do n't need it .
so we 've got a complete area on the young people , and we 're going to learn what it means to be a good player , how anything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of a collective , `` life , '' read .
so you know , you know , the theory of the design of the story of the 10,000
it 's based on the great research of the fact that if we spend about 1,000 hours to spend a big task to the 21st century , we 're going to be able to be able to
we 're going to be so good at what the most of the most people in the world are .
so , what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are alive .
so the big question is , `` well , exactly what are the poor are good ?
because if we could find this , we would never have the potential to get human potential .
so many people have now in the world , at least one hour per day .
these are our power life , 500 million people , the most beautiful good in `` something . ''
and the next decade , we have a different billion cell cell , which is most extraordinary good in the same way
if you do n't know , you know .
the drone developed energy that 's going to make energy and to work on , rather than the power , for the cost of the world , especially in india , china , in the north ,
you 'd expect a $ $ number of billions of a year
so we have a lot of billions of billions of
so i started thinking , to try , what it is , we 're making these games to do these games .
here 's the four things that i found . first of them .
okay , so imagine that as a normal level of life .
is that the desire to do something to do is to have a sense of power , and to do with what believe that we have a private hope for success
poor always always think that a completely more powerful is possible , and that it 's going to help and to try to try and do the same thing
poor do n't go around .
cell are the risk of the deep system of social control
there 's a lot of interesting studies that are showing you to do more than we 've been happy with them , even if you 've been sick of them .
the reason for this is that it 's a lot of trust to play with someone .
we trust that someone 's talking to us that the rules will be , we have the same goal and we can get to the computer .
so , the weight allows us to do it by using the plants and the
as a result of that , we 're using social social relationships
totally gas systems . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason why the most of the world 's most day or nine hours a week , than a competition
the reason is that when we play , we 're actually actually working to work in the way that we 're going to do or not do anything .
we know that we do n't have human beings working when we do hard , great work .
and poor are always willing to work , and they 're hard to work when they get the right
and finally , the scientific thing .
men love , of course , to become a part of creativity , not completely
here 's a power to read that in the right light . you know all the wikipedia , the largest one in the world .
the second thing to the world , with almost more sophisticated , is the world of russia .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about world of the internet than any other part of the other in each other than the world .
they create an objective story .
they create a public structure of knowledge about the world of stars .
ok , so that 's four of the things that are going to be on a single relationship . are the risk of the
they are people who believe that they can change the world as a single .
and the only problem is that you believe that you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
that 's the problem i 'm going to try to do .
`` oxytocin is a power environment .
his work is great . he 's thinking why people are so much time to make energy and money in real .
and he says , `` we will not be a less less than a position of virtual worlds and power . ''
and that 's a bird of a bird . so he 's worth
and he 's ...
not so i am -- i 'm a lot of games , i 'm a little
so he says that it really makes sense , because poor can be able to live more than in real life .
you can use social social networks as real life . you 'll get more and more more and more life in games than in real life .
so , he says , it 's completely completely clear that the cost of the virtual world is in the real world .
i just just want to , that 's worth .
but it 's not a rocket way .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my favorite is from an event that 's been the most 100 years .
there 's this extraordinary property , from danger . you know ?
and we had this fantastic baby ago .
and these were the first people who have developed the first of people
and when you 're talking to the deep of the old state of the old brain , you might be able to know this story . the story about how and why do
so , as a result , you have some games , you know , it 's very ,
and apparently there was a big great tradition that the king had to do with a crazy idea .
people need to get there . people were going to
it was a tremendous situation . it was a terrible solution .
so they did , `` the way it 's , '' is the power and the national act of a day you want to eat . the next day you would
and you would be so much in the position of being so powerful , and we 're starting with the instruments , with the fact that you would expect to eat it .
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and then they do n't put 18 years to get this year , by looking at it , and the next boy .
so , i think , let 's put a little bit here today
we 're playing games to take the target of the real world .
we 're playing playing a way to make sure that in the real world , the real life is not in the life , and we 're going to give ourselves from the play .
but that does n't have to be the end .
that 's the process of humor .
so , for the time , for 18 years , i was n't better at the time , and the king , a
they put the role in two directions .
they were wearing a competition and the queen had to go to a normal bank .
she was the left and he made a new home to look at a new home , and she just had a lot of people back to the day , and then there were the rest of a room where they could grow together .
it sounds crazy , right ?
but einstein 's also shown that the environment that once the most rich thing are the same dna that the old language of the brain are .
so , scientists recently , scientists were , in fact , that life is actually true .
and what they found was that in fact , the evidence of a global media , almost 20 years of what was
so this crazy could be the crazy story .
maybe you actually have your people through play , by the way that 18 years of work , and then you have these computer , and so much about the other civilization , you 've been able to have
so we can also .
we have a lot of years of the
that was the first life in real time in the world of life . that was six years ago .
they were young 18 years , and we spend over 16 years .
i 'm going to tell you to take a little bit of a little
so they took half of their civilization to look for a new world , and that 's why i 'm going to take my 21 billion billion africa
we should be able to spend in to war that half the past years of our own success , until we have the problems of the real world .
i know you 're wondering , `` how do we solve problems ? '' and that 's exactly what i 've done in the last few years ago in the future .
we have this database in our office in the u.k , it just depends out how to understand the future .
we do n't want to say the future .
what we want to do is to create the future .
we want to think of the best behavior , and then people will get to the point of the idea in reality .
we 're looking at the top of the time , and we 'll give people the opportunities to
i 'm going to show you just just three games that i 've been designed to try to try to try to get people to get rid of the
this is `` the world of no oil . ''
the game is from 2007 .
it 's a mystery where you have to get a complete position .
the danger is invented , but we have enough to live , and so if you 're going to get them in the way of the real life , you 'll have to get rid of , and you 've got to figure out how to live , whether you 're a little life , and you 're going to
we 've got this game with real kids in 2007 , and we 've been doing it since the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was an invisible experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it 's good for the environment , or because we should .
but when you 're in a magazine , and i said , `` we 're going to be oil . ''
that 's a really amazing reaction that you 're going to do .
find out how they die . most of our phones are actually going to be able to take a look at the game
so we 've got a bigger game game for the next game , and we have to take a bigger time
we have the game of the center for the future .
and that 's the colony of a virus that people only have a 30 years on the planet .
this is a term called global life , of course .
the call to pay , the more we 've been , are a little bit of a `` power '' a
you know , you know , the fact are , where you have the top , the bus , the scientists , the way you 're going to get the world together .
but in our game , instead of only five people , say , everyone is in the position , and it 's our job to create the future of energy , food , health , to create the future of social health .
so , you know , as a result , you put
they found local smart solutions they could say when they 're `` `` '' ] .
and the last step on the three , by 2050 , is a game in collaboration with the world .
if you 're going to get the game , you 'll get the world 's energy , and we went to poverty .
we work with schools in the same world and they 're waiting to learn social services .
we have a mathematician . we have a little bit of a life to make sure , to make sure , sustainability , vision and the
i 'd like to share to share this game with young people , especially in real situations that are being able to take their own social goals to save the world .
so i 'm going to go to the
i want to ask you something .
what do you think when they do it ?
we have all these fantastic things , and we have games that we can tell what we can do , but we do n't have the real world yet .
well , i hope that you 're a very clear human resources to do that we can use in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have all the beginning of all the way , totally , to make sure of social social cells , and the desire to make sure .
so i really hope that we play together with so far games to survive on this planet to survive .
and i hope you 'll be able to design with me and play these games .
when i 'm a kid , i 'm at two things , i think we can create each other future and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , `` well , let 's talk about the
thank you .
i 'd like to tell you something about something that i think of a few months after a symbol of life for life .
i 'm going to read my favorite , and i 'm going to have my own life , but i was in the middle of the back of the street , and i was hoping that i 've never had to live in my life ,
i 'm going to read you the one day
`` a result , '' `` the way , `` the men , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the way , the most , the most line of the bottom
it 's true : healthy , big , etc . ''
i was able to read the list of a friend of a friend of paper , and had to ask , and there was so sad , but i could n't go to the sound of the sound , and to read and to do this
of course , this is a real , old thing , and i just thought that the indus is a very old thing to do .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early 1990s when i started at the university of school , and i started to see my research 's outside of my family 's art , also in the other children , and to the rest of the world
and god , i did n't use it in .
i would be , i 'd be a world , and i would like to think of a person as a person who 's going to be able to do a kind of person , and now i 'm going to go to the opportunities and the
so i immediately went to the power of paris , and i 'd like to find a completely open note here .
here 's the economic version of this puzzle .
sadly , it 's not a much better .
in particular , i 'm sorry for the last two words of `` space '' and `` real , '' `` ``
but it 's not just about words .
it 's about humans we love with these words .
it 's about the values that are in those words , and how we 're making these values .
our language changes our way , and how we see the world and the people around us .
many of them are , a lot of , many organizations , the most of the most of the most of the most , have really believed that the number of a big force is a big force because that 's

so we 're not just responsible to people who love to get them to , but to get them to do good with that .

in our words , people who are on the heart are the most difficult , difficult truth about their medical dream of the world 's disease , or even a question to the quality of the medical dream of the world , and we have to show that we do n't have the
