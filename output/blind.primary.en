yeah , good day , ladies , my mouth .
and that 's very much for me to talk to you today .
and i need to imagine now .
my name is to be free , and i 'm , i 'm sorry to be a real , i 'm , to be a
that 's called a eight years of days .
and my favorite is : first of the first , second organization , the public matter .
so i 'm a very grateful part of this city .
and you do n't do it .
i know .
and that 's where it 's about , and that 's something which is very like my son , i 'm also a real .
that 's the head of the world 's head .
power is open and left .
and i 'm thinking , obviously , of course , is a challenge with me , where i want to make you today .
so with the point of the oil , because the one is writing .
we hope to the best and we 're still going to be on the worst , and that 's what we call a call .
you know it .
he was even in general .
and then i do n't start to say something like that .
i 'm going to make you a little bit .
so we 're talking to you , if there 's a risk of risk , that we 're just going to go to a more time , for example , to get
many people are on .
it turns out it 's completely true .
and somewhere on the screen is a family , richard , left , something you might do , maybe with your own .
nobody seems to be there .
the french one does n't need no one .
suddenly a tumor .
let 's get it .
they come , they 're , `` , get out .
people are called .
jenny flu .
go out .
what is it ? well , questions .
we do n't know that , or we ca n't say .
people are going to do the building .
children hate .
some of them might be , you might have , because it 's going to go to it fast
suddenly a discovery .
there 's actually open there .
a bird movement ,
i 'm going to talk to you here .
the rest i 'm going to do is their imagination .
but it 's not an idea that i 've got .
that 's exactly what happened in the back of this week .
there 's a such like a call in there .
and then they realized that only , just nine pounds of drugs in it .
but the people were just like this , and so a friend took me from the building .
it was not a surprise .
and it was this sort of thing that was happening at all the time in the group that my friend had been a friend .
god is n't an fear of being , otherwise there would be so much as hard as it seems .
you can see , in a fashion , a more more example of communication , a very important one .
communication is important because the people in this situation are based on communication communication .
they want to know what 's happened .
and then in the good few months ago , that was the most one for the number of the people .
we just have n't told us , or we 've got .
why ?
because the test is the same thing .
you have to say to be so bad , god , people in the company , there 's not going to be the truth or we say the golden islands .
that 's a time in a period of the social media , in a period of facebook , in a period of the world 's public and public school , in a period of power and the media ca n't do n't even go .
and the most thing that 's because it 's not a first thing , and the second is that we are the last time in the past , which is about the event .
you may remember , even , even in the european river , is a year ago .
the first one was about twitter at twitter .
from someone who was in a plastic station , and they 're just and the same , the most a plane , and we 're going to save people like .
that was not a competition .
you see , we 're on the point of getting the truth and make the truth to be very effective .
because of course , we also have the last , that the truth of the truth are , because we have to be an religious disease of what we 're going to do , we 're just going
these are public media , or most of the most media , not as well , or they do n't do it .
so , we 're going to eat in food , and that 's also a little bit of the media , we 're going to think about the future of the future .
and we 're going to do that with the great old art again .
but it 's just as a form of power .
so that means we 're going to put up in the next few years of about 100 tv systems in the environment that some of you know , it 's actually when it comes to the power .
and then it was in the back of that .
you may know , you know , what you 're three weeks , and you 'll go , and you 've got a little bit of time .
i do n't know .
we 're going to have to go to the far now that we have , in fact , about facebook , over the surface , and even at the bottom of the internet , and about the internet and the local media and the
and we know we 've got to go to very fast and we 've got to go and we 've got to go to it very quickly and very quickly , because the war and the human ,
and we also have n't been a longer thought of what we want to say .
innovation in the crisis or in the world or in the year is a question of corn about all the media that have to be alive , and it 's also a question of value .
and we 're able to do that is our biggest problem , because the pollution and the leaders are either , because the next time once , the more ones , or they say , it 's all much worse than it is in reality .
we 've also done good things with facebook and twitter , even recently .
and also , you know , maybe some of them are the media out of the media .
we 've got a bigger gap in food .
and it 's a social that 's called the chemical island .
these are successful successful , which is , in fact , not at the first stage of the world 's day , but in the middle of a chemical response , that a small one , the most high life is two key of each other , that they 're
the problem is , many of these soldiers have never been working , and are going to be able to get in the way of the other things in food .
and there we were , from a older , a little bit of the way , the one of the things that he wanted to go to the store , was , we 've now , he had been , he 's been in the right , and now he 's going to have the government to prove that there 's a
and by the time , many of the older family came out of this completely completely completely completely .
we 'll see what we 're going to do .
these cancer cancer must be at place , not to be a teacher , but to be a lot of them .
and so we 've seen a park , and we created a lot of the word , in the most sense of the word , a more famous bird .
and in the history of the city , the whole majority of innovation has to go over and twitter , and the news is far more likely to be completely happening about the other place .
and the media was very excited . even in the background .
we did n't even have to even with the first ones , but they have both and they have , all about power and twitter .
the whole had a great impact for us , because the value of the value is going to be the social media over these social media .
just because they have to give a hope , if i do .
i 'm not going to look at it here .
that 's the most successful idea because first of these social media have the advantage that they 're very different to go .
not so very , because the police who are there or the most expensive , as you call it , a high environment .
second , fast a.m .
if nothing does n't , then , somebody said , `` then , '' that the value of the only is clear , because the entire community is actually in the front direction of the world .
and it 's a very high amount of doing it , so if something is wrong , it can be very fast .
and we have a huge set of life .
i said , `` well , sure , that this is what a mistake in the dark park in the dark park .
so , we 've been looking out of all the things that are already in the last few years , and there are a lot more of more complicated than a half of a time , as a part of one .
the city , the city , is going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be
a hotel that has to be in a hospital , is not a kind of thing .
but it can also be , and then we 're also , as we 've been , as we 've been , in the position , and then we 're going to get our power and we 're going to
and when those of you think of yourself , you think of other cities , because you have a mouse , you have to have a sense of what you 're not afraid , then we 're now now now , you know , we 're going to have a series of thousands of thousands of thousands of
and that 's what 's important to do , is because it 's a world that has a world to do , to make innovation to make innovation , to make sure that people are being able to make sure that people are able to get in the situation , on this difficult situation .
and the social media helps us to be religious , because they 're not only only a single position of what we are in the environment , and certainly even in the big part .
so , today , not only a problem of the poor , not just a issue of cancer or the power of life , of the power , the red is going to be , but innovation in the more and form of a more period of the information .
and then we have this left .
there 's a lot of time , and about a second number of the people , if you 're a little bit of a life , because suddenly you had to build any color , and you never did n't even have any time to be
that is , there 's a lot of things to do , also , the public health health in the right , but the most beautiful thing in the world and the ice has just shown that the social media are n't even far away anymore .
and i hope that i 'm a little bit about that that the secret , that , is that the beautiful things of life is going to be , in fact , and the fact that we 're doing , the market , the
thank you .
so , a nice evening .
i 'm a very different different .
i 'm a writer and a while , as you 've heard .
and i 'm also even now even to do a own power for a very .
what it is that i 'm going to make up there , which i 'm going to do a lot of time .
before i do n't , i have to get some things .
the first is , i think we need to make stories to life .
we could n't live with any of the people .
and also , i think , there 's a lot more power , and there are some other stories that are actually going to be able to be able to be able
and then i 'm also thinking that the internet , the most successful , is that it 's just going to be pretty wrong .
and , of course , i 'm not grateful by that people have been able to be creative .
and they 're happy , as soon as they need to be creative .
the more people happy , the more we 're going to be the world .
it 's a huge effect .
so this better world is now a secret .
in fact , i 'm told , like , a hundred years .
and the story i want to tell you is by talking about a while in a very short place that is just the only one that 's going to be ,
that 's completely completely .
and it 's completely a paper 's book .
now , you get from the board and you do n't hear that much , because at the moment where it 's got to go back , something else is about .
it looks something like a head in your head , in your body , with your perception .
and she did n't really have any words .
you do n't know what 's going on .
i have asked to have a words .
i call this the secret of power .
you see the one page , and you 're in real and everything , you know , it 's quite black .
i 'm a feeling that i 'm kind of quite completely about .
it 's true .
and on the other hand , we have a lot of a different color on the very different ,
and it 's been said to this point that i 'm better and i write when i was a little bit of a fish .
so , the first thing that is now with your new form is a very powerful man who 's in front of you , you 're very serious , and says , `` oh , your life is over .
that 's completely completely .
and most of all , the whole thing about that are you to a very different kind of people .
she was born as a giant house .
the poor are people who have to play their lives on their own right .
who 's not like to be ?
very beautiful .
imagine if you 're a little bit of a little bit of life , when you 're going to do it , you 're going to get out of the
so , in contrast , are careful , power , everything else .
what 's really important is the risk of the risk have no special view .
we also know when we die .
i 'm not going to give you a long life of life , but we just do n't know .
it can be all at least all of us .
and then it 's also like that , too .
they do n't know how to be able to do it .
that means , every single word , could be the last one .
a cell phone , which has its entire life cell , is based on the power of a fish that is being completely alive .
now you can ask , and now , of course , if that 's dangerous , why do you get it , why do you do it
the answer is quite clear : that 's it .
without play , without a food to get rid of , everything else , and only when a cell player is , it 's actually alive .
they were born in the game .
so ,
this story of security and how you 're going to do the world of the cell , and you have to have a first better treatment , and , of course , is that in the very position , that 's the story i
and in a form of a competition .
the first line of 12 consequences , unfortunately , i 'm here a completely completely , i 've been able to have a little bit at the time .
so , 12 pieces of the first line of life in the first five minutes ,
this kind of power of power , a piece of the other , beautiful is just the ones you know .
and the bottom of his life is nothing for all of its own things .
that 's not new .
and if it was everything that , then i 've done one first time .
and even yet , you know .
now , it 's just right .
let 's go back to that again .
what is the most famous sentence from the film or from the table ?
it can just be a , right .
thank you .
so as we would have been able to do this again .
and that 's exactly what my audience does n't do .
so , by the way , there 's a whole lot of people who are there
there are so many different games .
think of real power , power , expensive , expensive and so forth . so , so forth .
and just so , the number of them is also the number of hands .
and then you see that there 's a lot of other stories that all just told .
now the next question is , who 's got to tell ?
i 've got a fairly high interest from me .
i think i 'm going to go to a smart , and i think , and i
but i know that a hundred percent brains produce more than just one , even if it 's my home .
so that 's why it came up to the idea that you put the privilege of the creative system in the way that you see the
what if we do n't just want to do it just or whether we 're not going to be able to do it ?
so if you say we 're going to go to a very , very close to a study of this device with power .
imagine , for example , for example , in the context of three three people , a completely brand they 're actually going to find a very cold , because they 're thinking about their grandmother .
and they 're also a huge fan of power .
then you can just now , with the technology of technology , not so hard to do it .
and this is what they 're looking at the site of life , where they are right , and that 's the really cool thing to really , which is really the same time .
that means it 's not going to be somewhere , but it goes straight right now , where it should be .
and that really beautiful us is that we are the internet .
and the internet , you know , is really everything .
so , every medium is worth of anything .
that means you 're going to write as a audience , and then you can also , and the way that you want to do .
and when we look at this , again , this structure .
this is something that looks like completely , like , is completely an internet , right ?
this is something that is what you get building in .
and i 'm really grateful on that the internet was born to tell the kind of stories of stories .
it 's not not that many , many , no one .
so , now i 'm going to go on now , but i 'm going to take the audience to the audience .
so , in a real danger .
you can also see against the same time of the physical industry , but also the people in the real environment are also able to have these power on their mobile cell .
in addition to the other thing , you also have all very good , so you 're going to do something like that water is going to be completely sustainable and
this is a beautiful amount of stuff that just created a very strange perspective .
and i do n't want to be able to do that , because i would need to do it again , i would need
we can also turn together .
everybody 's got to be a bit of three parts .
the first part is the most second one , the most and then we have the power .
so with this , i could say , with the most the the driver , i need to think that 's going to be a moment of innovation .
they 've had the first price for the best financial crisis .
and i have to say , this gentleman was from the gulf of the world 's life , the power , the power and so forth .
so , enough people , you should be mine .
and when i can convince the decision , here , with my mind , the internet is really using the same structure , the way that make the world , i think , i 'm actually going to pay everyone .
so ,
everybody 's got it , why does n't that be so ?
because only in this white , all the pieces of the whole being gone out .
and of course , we have a lot of the power : who 's got , i 'm a point , you 're on , everybody 's got to be .
of course , then die .
in the dark , very much more parents .
everybody 's supposed to be called , `` everyone has to die .
and of course , everyone is now to be the experience of everybody , if he wants to .
that 's really important to me .
i 'm going to come out from the power , and there 's nothing else about my opinion when it becomes a power .
i do n't know if you know that .
when you 're in the middle of the theater , and then the sound comes to the sound in the '60s and everyone 's like , oh , god , please do n't
and that 's not it .
so it 's about 30,000 people .
and nobody needs .
it can just be just dead .
the reason why i 'm a writer is that the whole project is also being a state of the first .
and that also has some reason .
i 'm a project that i 'm talking about , and i always asked to say , `` well , this whole thing is on english , '' less , less , blah , blah .
and i can only say , the average is the third in the world .
the danger is the english , and then the arts and then the city 's time .
so it 's not like we 're going to move in a little bit of little boxes .
and also , i really really really really , if there 's other people , that people will be grateful for something that is not being completely completely , where at the end of each other , each other is being completely completely being true .
if that 's all that way , as i would like to do it , then the first is going to go out at the first age of the first age
and when you ask now , why i 'm here today is with a real , where it 's totally completely under the name of the music .
and i also made some of the thought .
i love a lot of them .
not only is a power .
i 'm also quite responsible on power and power .
a few of them were also done and they 're absolutely there .
and i can just say that this whole knowledge is incredibly important and incredibly effective .
but it does n't use anything if you do n't get rid of it .
and my project is just a real thing , and just to get everything i 've learned so .
and it 's got the case .
and it 's good now .
i really do n't want to say to you , right ?
so , if you think about it , i do n't want to make my whole thing , i had a idea of a idea , and i 'm a feeling , and i 'm a feeling , and that 's what 's happening
you 're all in the internet .
on facebook .
great , how do you get the demand .
yeah , i 'm also .
say , `` can you feel invisible ?
question .
can it be useful ?
can you remember , in your life , what do you do ?
have you still forget about it ?
who has to remember , who 's going to happen ?
it 's not going to go up to the day .
so , you can use memory , right ?
it 's also happening .
thank you very much .
no , so , just so we want to do it today .
then , then , the talk is that it would be pretty close to be
again , my name is thomas .
the talk today , i 'm a little bit , because my two 's two big things are on the same time .
i 've been here in the right here that i 've been in the back of the research , and i 've been looking at the four of the four and the most popular , the most big
and most of a time , i 'm also as a student and a half of the private and the world 's field .
so on the one hand , i 've been looking at the computer so much , at the other side , and i 'm at the human point in the human being completely completely completely , so that 's the human being
how do you change it ?
it 's a collaboration of a collaboration .
i was a very interesting research in a very interesting research on the cultural intelligence , absolutely artists .
so , the question was , when we can , when we can build a computer that 's so how human brain can be as the human brain ?
so , and i 'm now now that we 're right close to right .
so i 'm thinking about two , three hundred years , more than that .
but let me just tell you why you might have a little bit of that .
so , between the computer , between the computer , and our brain on the other side .
if we take the computer , then we have a big , you have a big , you have a high , you have the size of your own , and you all have the cameras and you all have all the
it 's called a car , full of the world 's open energy .
these are the pieces of light from high city .
the word has already heard every one , and it 's always going to be as a symbol of it .
the tiny little piece of a little piece that has three things that has made a difference with you .
in our computers in our own business , i 've got to give you a little bit about five million million of these little parts .
and the street 's going out there , in the way .
we 're going to do things we can do things , we had to hear a lot of time , and we would hear that we can hear a lot of time , and that , you know , your computer can be able to do a lot ,
more than it does n't .
it 's actually quite a joke .
we want to be able to use the way we want to use the brain as
our brains has been as an adult , as a form of the brain , the most and we have , but there 's a hundred billion neurons in our galaxy parts in our galaxy .
the most beautiful thing is , our own neurons are not just three creatures that we have to do to get a light open up .
and that makes a completely completely completely completely , just only , is 10 trillion .
that 's 10 with the male age of age .
so , there 's a pattern of the brain , and a little bit higher than what we 're going to do when we have a computer .
we want to use the energy self , maybe the one or the other thing that has the first amount of work that had to have their own power to the top , the first , and the most air of the power is completely completely completely completely
our brand is sometimes sometimes , but the yellow is only about the size of the top of it 's about .
and that 's , and that 's the only one of two great workers , so they do n't need to do it , and you 've got to get a lot of it .
now , if we 're at the same puzzle of a good part of this , completely bad news , why do we use it , why do we keep it ?
perhaps the one of the brain in the internet , the human being only only 10 percent of its brain , or to be able to be the right to be able to be able to make the brain of the
and there 's just a little bit of a great thing to do .
ten percent , perhaps , but our brain is in our evolution to the genetic sector that we have , in the middle , there 's another way of our power , everything else has completely changed .
that 's not a matter , because we do n't use it .
why does it so that we 're going to get the biggest part of this ?
maybe you know the story of the script ?
i 'm going to talk to you about the fact that you see the conference , when you look at the course , you see the floor , you go up the top , you get the sun , you get a competition .
and those 10 percent of the top , which is that of what our desire , our own mind , are the same percent , but a normal amount of a brand , a healthy amount of life ,
we 're going to make the answer of the fact that are completely completely likely to be completely active by the fact that we 're going
and , in order to get power on this memory , maybe the one or other people with the power of it .
people who remember a lot more attention than i was n't seen who would be in the situation and the people who would tell you , but i said , but but well , how do you know ?
that 's a really , there 's a really , a bit of a call , a little bit , someone who 's got to do , in a plane , and then they 're not really so fast , so the
and not so , so that 's the kind of the brain , and there is this , no , every single house , every single eye , every single surface he has seen , he 's got it back to paper .
where do we get from that ?
so why ca n't that , well , the more matrix is perhaps very close to the fact that the indus is more likely to do the same percent of the entire percent .
now we use that , but why ca n't i remember the high day of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the
jenny zurawell , at the same time , is something that was interesting to me .
he has worked for an example of the u.s. system , and he was working with a plastic , and he had completely changed her , that was n't more listening to the brain , that is n't even going to happen .
wonderful , so that was very good .
now , it 's just about being being true .
and that they 're looking at a very positive thought , and they ca n't remember that in the end , even if they could n't see the phone of the cars , where these people are , that was n't going to
and in fact , with this baby , one of the audience had been turned up .
the second thing i found was a woman in the classroom , who told me that her mother had read her in the morning , as she was a little , so four years ago .
and there she came on the car car and her mother 's read .
and then he said , in the gold , on the gold , it 's time .
then they started to get , she was four times , she could n't read , but now she 's going to do this .
and then they told me , `` he said , tell me the power .
they actually found a copy of the city in the gulf , where exactly at that side of the text , which is the old read .
so the brain has this simple thing as it was completely open , as a picture .
and then they tried to read it .
so , we actually have access to it , but we 're actually going to tell you the potential of the world to do not to get us to .
now , we 're not going to go to the idea of the event , but how do you say , it 's got a picture , a little one , we 're going to hear what we 're going to do , and what we 're going to do , is that what we 're going to do , is that what we 're going to do , is that what we 're going to do , is that what we 're going to do , is , if you 're going to do it right , you have to have a
and , it 's now a long night , and they 're getting free , and they 're little going to go , and then i can ask her , come up just a little bit of her eyes .
and remember , a very definition , a little bit of the time in the west past .
take the first thing .
and if you do that now , you might be able to get the evidence of being a part of a physical part of this memory .
you might get a picture , maybe a movie ?
some of the things that do n't think about it , because we do so normal , but that 's what makes you to do for the first time .
and when you see that , then you can be either in the movie , from your eyes all of the way , or how it 's looking at a screen .
that one we call is a power , the other power .
thank you very much to have the idea of the idea , you need to get the eyes back .
who has it , a society , is it going to go to the left ?
yeah , so you go to the front of the hands , which is that , `` the yellow is about what i 've been asked , it 's actually something we do so that we do n't really understand it in the first moment .
well , keep it on .
but , in fact , that 's a beautiful thing to find , if you 're not able to see it , it 's not just the same thing that we 're going to see , you know , it was beautiful , because it 's very beautiful , it 's a lot of the memory , and there 's still a memory that 's probably
and now what happens is that ?
and everything was all before that , well , that our brain is not a difference in which we actually have , and what we 're going to do is we really want to look at what we 're going to do .
and also , you can imagine , if you 're in home , you 're looking at something in the future , and you 're not going to see something that 's going to happen to you , you 're going to see something like something , if you remember something ,
and , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , these stories are like , you know , in the dark of
so , in the back , there 's this , and that 's so nice , and the times of the stories , the story , the beautiful and the story of the people who are there , there was a lot of carbon , because there was a lot of more interesting , because there was a lot of more
so if we do that in the classroom , so if we really do this kind of memory , we do n't really have the same thing , i do n't know , do n't we
it 's true when i came here , i 'm a picture of my own image from his childhood 's in california .
a very beautiful image , it 's also a very beautiful dynamic .
only , the picture is a little bit more beautiful than the most popular , so it 's a very beautiful student to do , because there 's a beautiful dog that 's actually the sun on the surface , that 's a picture of this
and why do n't we have our own thought of our own memories , and what would tell me , when i 'm still a little bit more , what i think i think i 'm going to think about
they actually have a sense of freedom to their own thought .
are you so many people you see them , if you 're just so light , what is there ?
i said , `` bad , i went to the whole gap through the head .
and the whole night , and this thought , did n't get me anymore .
i think it 's the way he got to do this .
the son is a friend of mine , a little bit , when he came to germany because his mother was sitting in the wild , and he 's just just very famous .
so what the dad did was , he 's got a student who said , and she said , or have asked , what was the most beautiful thing about today ?
what was the beautiful , somebody wants to , and then he would tell him , he made him completely , and he 's just telling the story , which is a great moment .
and , two weeks ago , the son was the last thing .
and then it was -- that the mothers are going to get back to end again .
and that 's the whole age of this that 's now the most of the most people i know of .
so it 's not the memory that are changing us , but it 's our focus on what we use .
and how much energy on it is or use .
so if you 're going to do completely , you know , this is now now , that 's the time , and you 're going to do it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you do n't have this thing , you know , you do n't have the
so what we do is , what we 're doing is , `` is it 's based on , '' a great , that the great thing that we 're doing , you know , `` well , that 's really a real thing that was beautiful
and then you take that , you know .
take a look at your real and let 's take the genome .
or if you 're going to get rid of somebody , you 're going to get your head , or your wife , or your husband , the ones , you 're going to get it out
so , take the image , you get an amazing little bit of fun , dead .
power is completely with power , so you 're in the blue office , you 're laughing , why are you going to be able to do it
because they 're open to each other , because it 's funny .
and you can get a lot better with the situation of the situation .
can it be useful ?
no , i think our brains has so much better to it , that it can be all the way of all .
but it does n't matter , but we can choose to lose free , so we can do the research and how important we 're going to do an experiment , a memory , a thought , it comes from us .
my favorite self to you , you 're playing with the images of your life , you take the power of your mind and you get to get it every day you 're going to make your life .
bad afternoon .
thank you for a very , very much for me .
when i ask a patient , i 'd like to do something in my presentation and tell you that i 'm going to go with friends and then , and i can see color and i see the most of the most
when i realized that it 's a call for a classic music , then a student would be , in fact , that the former brothers were inspired pictures of the old people who are in the very position , and very much effective to the art of
bill 's `` french , '' to speak about , is to say , is just as much as architecture .
and so , so much of what we 're doing is that what we 're doing .
so you can get a little bit of a piece of view , i 'm going to give you a short movie .
and then ...
radio is actually made by the way of making simple simple power .
that 's what it 's doing to be the best part of my view .
since a lot of time , the power of the power of the power is to make something completely different .
we 're now eating up in the face of the car and the middle of the year , and they 've been seen very early in our early , which is incredible power and joy to the original music
but we also also also have the idea that the more matrix of the power and the power of us is a little bit of a more , a little bit more .
and we 're also convinced that the laws of the law of music music is not to the content , so on its own life , but in its life .
so we 're looking at the question of how we can make a difference that the music is going to go around , and that 's the way that we 're going to have , and the force are coming to the
how do we create a completely life that 's going on the edge of the space ?
we 're asking the cell phone that you know from the traditional wall , space , time , light , the context , right in the question .
take the relationship between the relationship and the fuel .
normally it 's between the stage , and the one 's a power system .
we 're trying to do the test .
so here 's a picture of our power .
the older brothers are in the audience , japan , and they 're going to go to the food of the food , are on , you know , two pieces of data , put back in the audience .
the whole thing is going to be a little bit of a life at the back of the
everybody who 's known with the stage , come back to the stage .
or that 's the office .
in the national book , in the national office , is that you do n't get more or less , you get a lot of the way you see here , you go and you 're looking at the
there 's music , there 's actually not going to be there .
and we 've made it as we can do it .
if you can go differently and you can do a completely piece of music , then you hear it differently .
and then we get a little bit of that , and we had n't put four of the audience out there .
the audience could have lost .
so , at the day , everyone in the first row of each other .
important to us , we do n't just make any set of life , but we 're going to think of the music .
so that we ask , what are blue and exciting , but also in the air of people need the music to be so so can be able to do it ?
and so , in the way , the only night went to the bottom house in the field , the most line of the main is of the most expensive , in the background , in the most of
but not just the spaces and the birds can get to the ground , and still go , but also the connection with other people 's going to be .
and so we 're very happy that we 're working for a few years ago , which are working with us to make the brain of the music , and to make us feel , actually , that 's not the end of the
and so you get power for free , or for the power of eight dimensions .
and in this year we have a , if you want to get rid of the way .
we 've had a very deep together with a competition with a very light .
we have the story of the american government with a clear , built , and it just makes us to a completely completely scale .
that has been so much important , because we had a huge amount of life that we put in this piece of time .
we have a lot of money from people from quite high areas that we could afford to do the system .
at all , this is a little bit something that is going on in a community of a community .
we 're incredibly happy to find up from the blue floor in the middle of the blue environment .
the city is exactly so large that we can find beautiful spaces and work in the way that we can do , but also so small we can do .
when the year in the year two weeks ago , two weeks of a sudden , are on the city of europe , and then it 's just going to be able to do that in the city , more people with
the whole script is going to be used by the way to be a
we 're a famous fan of students and students , who are , are , very , very , very completely completely .
and to make a completely completely completely , a completely brand , that is the most expensive or the wind and the police in a very , five to 10 or 10 , in a very tiny , which is for a year for a year
and also , in fact , you 're looking at a year , for example , for example , for example , for example , or the power that are being available in both the hands and the way to be honest
we all have this in our own and living in the middle east asia .
that means that the biggest part of the work is getting a real , and it 's a real level of life
only three times in year , we 're going to put a hole on the year , and we 're going to do the one or the other problems that are already , and also the most common thing that 's just really important if you want to be able to
to the conclusion , to the u.n. , to the local , to the local , to the other , to a few weeks or a few weeks of hands , and there 's where people get to be someone , to be able to get it to the
and of course , in those villages , the fbi came to be .
now you could , you know , you need to do anything about it as a call .
but our power is still going on .
we have a huge community to us in the city that we want to do in what we want to do .
this is what 's going on the design level , which is also about very much , very dangerous things like the high school , because we have a box that 's going to be with bread or a life that has to be healthy to us .
that 's completely going to be a double in a hospital and a half of the year in the city , and it 's called
until you go to the power .
we found a whole bunch of different things that we 've been able to put in the living room to make the peace there .
and in this way , the music has been to be able to get to a very , in this city , and from the people in this town .
they 're looking at a very different way of like this , a very different way of music .
since we did , since we were , we were able to put out of the food in the local world of the world that 's now all the way that the whole big thing is on a tree and
we 're losing out of the most of the most of the most of the things that god 's music , it 's going to be
so we 're incredibly proud of that that 's in the europe of young students , and they 're going to take a look at the other hand in the cities .
if you still ca n't imagine that as well as the word of god music gets like , then you just get over .
so , the next year we 're back to is we 're back to see , and we would tell us , if you 're there , then
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learn .
you might think of god .
knowledge of learning , or the effect of learning , but i mean , for learning , is that completely completely completely true , and it 's true to right .
knowledge experience , a beautiful act for the power .
so what i 've learned from art and culture is , i can say a lot of new things , because now , you know , i 'm going to get that in this field .
and so i 've been thinking that maybe it 's true to give this thing , to give a different perspective to what i 'm talking about .
art is beautiful , it 's a lot of work .
now , you 've got to have a guess of yourself now .
you always get the most powerful , even though the most ones knows .
why is this ?
i think that 's what it 's about to do , in the word , that we ca n't be able to do that right now .
art , which we 're also , sometimes , is what .
so , to work , we do that , which has this .
sometimes even .
people who like to work , that 's what i 'm going to do .
but at work , we think we 're going to do something about the environment and the art of the rich aspects of the cell , where we 're moving to our experiences , our own imagination .
and so i 've been looking at my own , i 'd like to take some of the two hours in five hours , which is all the time that i 'm talking about , which is just easy for you .
it starts with the power , for the night , to the end , to the end , to my company , i 'm not going to be the word of my research , so then on , the word `` i '' i 'm going to have
the one of my favorite part of my life of life and family , five , more .
a half one of them will know that will be the size of the total of the total of the most island
it 's true , two and the ones it is .
you learn it in the first two , three years , and you want to get the kind of a way , and i 've seen a lot .
and so with 10 , 11 , i 've seen these little pieces of them , on the car , not from here where the power is going to go home .
these are the pieces of life from a competition .
there 's a little bit of a strange and the other voice , but it 's very different .
the marketing line is the same thing , but it 's completely .
and that , ladies and gentlemen , is a little powerful in the art that it is about , and if it 's only two simple voices , the future , the world is sometimes , in the process of the world , in the
and i 've learned , two , two , sometimes , to play the danger , to play , to hear any kind of thing , the one that does n't hear .
that was what i learned to be , like , some other .
another time i 've never forget , and i 've had the chance to have , i might be able to go to this now .
i have a writer , there was still more people in the room today , and in the middle of the room , i came out .
i forget it was supposed to forget .
i 've played a lot of paper .
so again , at the end of the same , i knew that again .
the audience has more longer than i , because i went to all the career on my place , and i put my chair , and i started to go back and i started the third one .
and they do n't believe how to put it up .
but that was a very serious experience .
maybe that was one of the things i knew , well , with the age of , even if i was quickly , i 'm going to go to a conversation , i 'm not going to go to my mouth , because at least , you
yeah , the next thing i 've been the next one i 've been in my career is i 've been able to love and i 'm going to tell you
when i was so strong , i went to my life and told him , rather , mr. enough , i 'd like to play a little bit .
and he said , `` the other thing is not .
there you have to have a lot of hot data , and a lot of experience with women have been working on .
now imagine , a little bit of young man , so , boy , such a second .
i do n't forget that .
and from that i 've been talking more .
i was a believer , and i was in a position .
i 've been a time , and i remember a situation that i 've never seen .
it was the most power of the community , and now i 'm going to go to the big work , i 've just been able to go , and she was the most beautiful , and then there was the poor , and then there 's
i 'm not going to be a good time , not a little girl , and i ca n't even have it anymore .
i 've got this one 's six , i 've seen the same one , and suddenly , you know , a lot
and then i left and i 'm going to go back and i 'm going to put it on , and i 've been able to get myself in a company , and i 'm just going to see that i 'm
i was myself for myself .
i did n't have a little bit there , nothing else , and the music did this with me .
and one of the experience , where i learned , emotions really , really , really , really .
and sometimes it 's also true to work that you 're in this kind of extraordinary tissue , in this state , i call it the case .
where everything else is .
we had actually seen this situation to be in the environment of the organization in the organization .
and then there was almost all the way of self when we did the environment , it 's only a few months where you would spend a few years .
now , that was my ideas with the heart , with sure working with work .
and now i 'm going to come to my grandmother , to the bottom .
i had had been a student before , but it 's a competition .
we have made up , we have , we 've got , right .
i have a little bit of a life , and i 've been so much of my life to the music and the power of it .
in the air , in the air , together , a brand of them , a very clear experience that i really have very quickly .
and then one thing i came up with a nuclear theater to the most theater , in which is the most and the most , and i 've been made this idea from this combination of art , and i was in the right position , and i have a job
so , the art of culture can do to make culture to my own life .
so , here 's the art , but not as a artists , but , you know , you would n't say , but as an open and a little bit of doing something .
i was there in the middle , and i 've been , there was no copyright , i 'm a writer , and i 'm a little bit , and i 'm going to do this question , and i 'm going to do this , and i 'm going to do , to do , to do art , to make a good
and that was why i also have been a little bit of my life to go to this kind of thing , and i was in the right of the time , i was able to go back
but before it was another place , and this came to the left , i 've got a little bit of the people .
i 'm going to be on the hospital .
the average danger has its own life in danger .
i 'm a life , even though i was born in life , because i was always there , the most expensive life of that i 'm going to do , i need to make it a bit .
but i have a open business , because my own family had been completely completely completely , and there , in the most of the day , i 've seen the most few of them .
that was something that i had n't been , and suddenly i 've been able to go into another form of culture , in a way , in a culture that is being built by human beings in this kind of thing of power .
once the press were on us , all of us were in a very different situation in the different galaxy .
and i then have been on with power , the local power and the most of my friend , and in and so there , we 've always been able to call the competition of the room , he 's been , i 'm going to have a different , he 's got to be , i could n't
we made the competition on , so , of course , on the face of the power , we talked about , you know , a lot
and that little thing that came out of the people came out of the people .
it was my computer that i learned most of my life on the morning , and i 'm not sure that the wall was .
i was a kid on the next day , i had a writer , oh , the wall is really , yeah .
and i 'm still going to go back to any questions of the life of the time .
and there was a line of the cities in the star .
and i 've also seen how many people like the same kind of different in the two of these languages .
in fact , we 're going to talk to the same language that music has been there , and it has been beautiful , but it was a lot of a lot
unlike the day , not from the people of all of the people , there was a big , i 've made a big , a big , of the way , to some of the american identity that i 've been talking about , again , the average community , and the average
and then we thought that 's the second time that 's called the
now , at the very few times , a lot more of more power is happening .
in the future , i have been able to experience all of things that are learned , and that 's where the city is .
we 've got out of the way that i had a huge , so you can imagine that , when i started here , i started to live on the planet and the other .
i have a lot .
now , at some point , for sure , you wanted to write it 's hard for culture and security .
i was the first of the first mind of life .
so i did n't have a few times , so that was wonderful that i had this life , but they were going to be , because i could do and i could do it in education , and i could do it with education .
we have a lot of work for the economic system , and we 've just seen this guy 's , and you see that , you know , you know , the most environment of the world , right where you can see the relationships between the design and the architecture , from the
many , many of the buildings we could , and i could take it and i 've done , and what that means is when different people from different jobs together a target .
and you notice that , i always become more and more of the art that we have , that we can take the sound between people , between culture , in the way , in the direction , and i 'm going to come back to
and in fact , in the way , the subject then we were , the most time we were , are , we have the seven government ever had the idea , the former age , that could be able to keep
but this last project , this village has been the ultimate record , and it 's the most famous thing to
this word has two main , and i 'm going to give it to something i can do something , and i can use it as a name , and i say , i 'm going to know , i 'm doing something .
and it 's always in its face .
i know something with his favorite , so i say , i 'm going to give you , or the community or the community .
and i 'm talking to something i 'm going to do and say , `` i 'm sorry to be , '' and i 'm going to try to do that .
and that 's a very big deal .
five million people are trying to move , and to move , live cities , to make them more of the way that you can see a community in europe .
as a big , we 've got open , but even as a community of many people who are in a large galaxy , but at least a common language , even if the genes are here , and this is our ability to do the
in the same hand , the price of the amazon , many other languages .
a experience of life has not been so many people .
there 's a tremendous line of life , and eat , two schools , the most young students , and young students , from the top of the school , from the top to a game that is home , to
and it was a unique effect that young girls would send , and young people would then get the police out of young men from germany in a little bit more organic .
and there 's one of those young men in the university , and i gave this very complex that i loved .
and then , he was , he 's got a letter , and she said , `` i 'm a writer , '' and i wrote to her , when young husband he was , and i could never play a little bit there because my two is just the same .
and he 's making his fingers with a life , he 's going to go back to the bus in this game , and he tried to play the competition .
and it did n't give him .
it was so much that a magic i 'm asking , is said , `` what did we learn ?
we learned to have a lot of people to move there , but every things we learned is that we 're going to go to the world of peace and the culture that we 're not going to do n't , because we 're going to talk to each other languages that we
and that was a wonderful experience for me , and you can see it 's not just about learning .
it 's always learning to do something and make it available .
and when we take a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of time , and we 're going to go to the culture of our own room , to our own position , to our own identity , to the point of our own identity , by taking us to
and i hope that you have a lot of them and have some kind of thing that you 're going to do this .
thank you very much .
yeah , thank you very much .
i think we just have a picture of the first picture .
so i 've got to get to the support of my apartment , this is a few of the slides .
but it 's not a scientific view , but it 's really about to find a direction and i 'm going to do with a point where i think that 's going to be the next year we 're going to do this .
and so , by the way , the number words that i now finally , thank you for that , i think , is what i think is , in the area , we can not get this talk
and then i had heard of it , and if you look at it , if you 're going to look at it , you know , you would n't understand what i 'm going to english , i do n't really know how to say , and so i put the talk back to
as we die , we die .
i 've got to tell you one of the time of being there .
and it 's been a patient in the hospital that i 'm living in , and was it .
she was always going to be over the same age , and it 's always been able to be the one of the people who was in the first man who was in war .
and so , it 's been a very recent time to the first , and then a long time and probably to do a completely , a completely , very common , and then it 's got a very strong , and then it 's got the light on the right side , the
a few years ago , she also had a very different , and had a very kind of good experiment , and then the left was left his left .
and then i was there , there was a doctor and i 've done how to be used in the kitchen , and also got to be used with them , and have the research looked like , `` because because should anyone be able to do it ?
does it really make sense of this as a old human being able to make a very old use of how to make it useful
so , in the way , the way to measure , is that one people who has to do ?
and she 's been used to be huge .
five years later , i 'm going to get the name , and i can not even tell you , because he 's so hard , and then at the time , the other leg
so , the question is , what do i do , when i talk about how a person in his mouth , what he is to do , `` what do you do ?
and that 's kind of a little bit of the subject of the day .
you see the power of the end of how we die .
it 's a book from us , how to work , a question about the time .
and then it was so that the globalization was very strong , so you asked , how do you think it 's going to work , then you can do it ?
you then have it , and you can still say that in this book today , because it 's going to be a community , so that the parts is always going to go .
it 's going to be a force of the work , and it will also be a lot more likely to go , for example , in the country that was a big deal .
and that 's also so that in the same time , it 's a little bit of a kind of thing that has some kind of thing , and the only time that it 's always being more likely to use , it 's always more likely to use the quality of the quality
and that , after my point , people were still able to work and more and more of the little life , where it was about to do the whole lot of time , and not more about the way of being able to explore his work .
and when we now do that , we go to the environment and medical medical space , so there 's a sort of evolution there .
when you hear about television , which are like doctors , or also , you know , most of the time , and also , it 's called danger .
and that does n't mean anything else , and it has to be the case that it 's cheap to get it , and if you 're not enough , then you say , the medical thought is to be the most and the medical treatment
and through these perspective , you can still make more and more more and more more effective than that , you 're going to be able to get your work and using use of personal , on the beauty of a
a great friend of mine is now after the outside of the outside , because he 's not going to have this , he had a huge amount of , has to be the left , and is to become a doctor to be a doctor .
the danger are now a very step on these tools , and it 's been , the professor , who has only been , that there 's no old people going to go between the back , in the hospital , and back , because the
then you get to the hospital , you 're going to be clear , go back into the back , or for the back , and then you get there
and that guy had to learn if it 's in the process of the process , then i would like to go to the point of the way that you 're going to get some of this kind of water of the power and the whole thing that is also completely completely
now , in 2003 , he had had been able to find the language of the language that there were a lot of fun to be there , that there were exactly exactly the same thing that was happening at this point
it 's also going to be a private molecule for the time to the people .
it 's not more the light that 's important , but you have to get yourself in a very clear , and i want to be not careful , or not in the hospital , if i 'm in the back .
and then the goal then will .
in the meantime , it 's kind of , like , the third days has this conversation with the talk of , and you have to get yourself , i want to be in the hospital , or i do n't want to go to the hospital if
that 's exactly what i want to do , i want to be a bit of a way to be , or i
so this data , then , is a real and there is this doctor for life , has always been the most and the most one , and then the decision of this creature .
now , when we get to open up , we would have been able to have the bit of the little and the ones that would have been , and we would n't imagine , you 'd have to have this second , and then you would have this second , and then you 'll get it back ,
and the one 's one friend that i 'm going to do that in kenya is very much more , just to do with this .
in the last last case , today , today , about the other percent of people not die about , in the north schools , and these are the most popular life of the old life , but it 's often a strange , rather , a strange , of a deep , of a sudden , that you 're all often , and the
there is a little bit of a community that has very good at , and so i 'm going to get the most position , and we 've been so about so on , so about so on , so about , and so , you know , in the year , and so i 'm going to say , it 's hard to say , there 's
the whole thing is , of course , has an clear thing , that is , this whole business , that is , because the people who are so much of the money are that they 're going to say , that there 's a lot of the people who are going to say , i 'm going to go to , i 'm going to , for instance , a family of
that 's not just the reality , but you need two degrees in the environment and the most and the most likely it 's just going to be .
this is a recent industry of the human industry than a result of a lot of the people that you want to get , so it 's also the individual being of the
and now i 'm going to start to get the way that you might be able to do so what we 're doing in the last , because i 've asked the same questions , and the situation is so simple , so it 's just the situation for
and i just got the most and the article of the paper of it , because i think a society has a different structure that we have all the most , which is in our society .
and in the very complex paper , it 's just a huge one .
and the second thing is , you 're going to protect a second issue of all the life .
and what i 'm sometimes is , there 's another one , a second sentence that there 's every single one of the most one that 's ever been to be able to protect it and to the government .
because the one way to be clear from this talk , i 'll give it to other -- and that would n't have to go around me , and then i do n't have to do anything about how i 'm going to die .
because the last thing is , but as we do n't want to tell us , we 'll get to the point .
hopefully , it 's just a long time , with a hundred or a half or
that 's where i 'm very interested , that i 'm going to be , but , but you know , you know , you know , you know , you 're going to have to do this , and if you 're right , you know , you 're either in life , you might be in life , and you 're going to be in the life of being ,
now , if you think about it , what do it do , then you will go to see , where there are the last line , what is the five facts in my life ?
there 's a book that 's quite accurate .
it 's the most of us , and it 's the friends that i have , with me , i 'm going to explore , which i know about the life , and it 's the most danger .
it 's safe to do the people who i might have done , in the same or the same piece or a `` a '' or a life or a different person , with which i mean in animals .
and there 's lots of lots of many of the most of the most of the world that are there , and i do n't want to go to
but if you look at these three points , you have a lot of the amount of data , and you have to be able to have to live in the life of the last one , and to protect it in the last side of your
and then another thing that we 're going to do is we even seen a certain body of the environment , and i 've just had this one as a text or as an example of it .
other people can take us to use these decisions and understand that behavior , which is not there , not .
that 's my most room .
and we would only get to look at ourselves from ourselves .
so it 's not the question of what you 're going to do , who is , who i 'm going to do , is it , or , for me , who are going to be on me ?
but it 's real possible to ask , where i can actually , in humans , i 'm able to make myself , and my room would have been so much of me to be able to understand these questions and make me
and then , when we 're working , how we 're working , so this is a way of being on the outside , it 's a way to say , i would tell myself about my own life , this device .
because no man can i have to let me see what i 'm going to see .
and i 'm not going to be able to say , not in a general environment or the way , you 've got to have a google , and you 've got to be so old , you 're trying to be able to get up if you 're going to be able to
so these questions , i can probably be probably the same time in the last time .
and this would be a very public device that 's not , and not to do the outside of the outside , and i 'm also going to be able to do other people , and i 'm rather likely to have the fact that i 'm going to have a lot of people , and i 've got to have a human deal with
and to do these experiments , it takes a whole room and that i think , and i 'm going to have this talk , and there 's a picture , and there 's a picture that 's going to be , in a picture , and that 's not what 's going to be , you know , maybe that 's not
so we 're old , you can say , well , you know , that 's the one in the words , despite my little high school , that would be even time .
thank you for your attention to your attention .
nice good evening .
i 'll give two things .
when you 're the first part of them , you 're a little bit of a little bit .
it 's another second one .
let 's start with the bird .
that 's scary , not , can it .
what do they mean ?
are there different ?
or is it grateful enough ?
yeah .
that 's not good when you 're a deal , what 's wrong ?
so , in fact , i 'm going to start it , for the one that you know .
that 's not what we do .
we 're just moving around one single .
and i 'd like to make a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of
so , we know , we know , we know , we know , we 're able to know , we
and it 's about the power of a variety of different species .
when we 're in the parking field , and two are two of them in the one for example , in the other hand , in other people .
we know , we know , we 're looking at the box , the number is small , and it 's three of them , and they 're three people .
we can not , if we 're a lot of the same number of elements ?
so , are we , how would we do it ?
that means we 'd only get people to do , two , three , we 'll get the back , see three degrees , one , two , three , three and three three , three , and wonderful .
what they do , yes ?
very beautiful .
this works in a very difficult great way , and it 's also working in big numbers , even though it 's going to
but it does .
how do you get it even ?
how do you get that much of people like this ?
i have a choice of a , and people and not come to the other .
so , go !
you call it !
you know , this is clear , not , now we 're in the tree , and we 're also going to understand that .
not , that 's very beautiful .
so , you know , it 's an competition that has a competition , and it 's just the same time , right
you take one , you go on a chair , you 're on the mouse .
the next thing that is , you know , the next thing that is all is changing , and different people will get different , and the amount of things that are there is the size of the
now we 're going to go into the main field .
how do we get two options to two ?
we would say that one is like big or bigger or less than the other .
so we could do it ?
we would go back to .
right , that 's wrong because the point is that if you start to get a little bit of a long long , i 'd just say , you 're not going to be a different .
so , are careful , is sure , right ?
so how does it go ?
glamour ?
it 's got a joke .
she had been , but she was right .
chimborazo !
so now we 're going to look at it .
does n't think about yourself bad , right ?
you see , you 're not going to see that , yeah ?
the point is , you make it just easy .
if i take a look at the power of the open , natural numbers , and we 're going to do the food to the zero to zero , one , two , three , four , five .
and we 'd say , let 's say a little bit of that , and take this kind of little rich , the most famous number of the most successful numbers
left on the right , the one is , okay , two , four , six , eight , live ?
okay ?
all the details are based on the most famous long book of the natural life , but on the one , the `` a '' is the power to the other and the power of the people , '' on the other hand
and we 're going to have a lot of the very small kind of the danger of the most simple , we call the other amount of
what do you think ?
is an powerful tool , it 's bigger than a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a
the same big ?
but that 's very , very powerful , yeah .
who 's another point ?
small ?
who is bigger ?
`` ah , that has no plan , '' yeah ?
that can not be , yeah ?
you ca n't be , where do n't we do bigger , you do n't get it ?
okay , you know , you know , you know ?
would you be thinking , not ?
that 's the most bad thing you can be , of course .
and now now i 'm now now why the whole one is there .
how does it work ?
right .
yes , we 're hungry .
that 's the point .
we 're hungry .
we take the zero out of the site , we take the zero out of the natural lot of the time , and we 're going to take the
the next one is two , two , two , two , after the zero gets off , and i 'll get a power .
the four ones that are two who are young , who , eight , who are four ?
you can also , and then you can get the amount of money , that 's obvious , right ?
and clearly , by the way , we can do that , i think it 's always going to be a completely open on this kind of thing .
and here 's one , there 's just the lights on the right , and the `` the face is just so long , right ?
we are creating the natural system on the site , and are very much , and the bus is still quite long .
that 's just just a rule of the rule .
so , when you ask some questions , what do we have learned today , you know , what is dead , i know , do n't you ?
a clever amount of a brain has not do a brain that has n't seen in the very difficult system , and that 's the character , is clear security , a real amount of mass that is just so
and they do n't get that in a classroom , if you 're sitting from three three people , there 's still one place , and before there 's three people .
yeah , we made up some other .
is n't it a little bit ?
okay .
then we 're going to do a second part of it .
the press , the creative need .
here 's what it 's like .
so , in this experiment , i 'm sure , is it at least a third , and it 's going to do it with it , that does it mean ?
so , we call the skin a , b , c .
i looked at a little bit of a way , i hope , you do n't know .
and you want to be good news now .
where do i mean , i 've got some lights , a guy , b or c ?
guess what , our life , here .
they 're laughing at english .
who has another idea ?
a one is a big one .
who has another idea ?
bad , smoke , b has a little bit of a second , but maybe that never would say , get it up ?
so , here 's the right .
it 's really really impossible , so you do n't have to be able to get three and i 'm looking for me .
it 's really not , yeah ?
it 's completely clear , because the reason that they 're lucky is that it 's only a third thing .
so , in the way , there 's three things , it 's really not , yeah ?
now i 'm going to do that , i just do one on .
well , i know , of course , where it is .
so , it 's true , and that 's what you 've got to do .
so , i know where it 's , and the principle and the matter of it , or whatever it 's called , it 's going to be a second game game .
so i 'm really going to take the message now now , right now .
so it 's so we go to a second game game .
now , i thought , well , i 'm on this one , right ?
so , now i have to show a list of where it does n't , and it 's not told you .
because if you say to b , and i say , i know , it 's not your name .
then there 's no second one .
then i say , `` well , '' of the mouse , i 'm sorry .
but i have to say , that 's a male thing to go in the second game .
so i can only get one line of view of it , and it 's not just not , but what you 're not told .
now the question is , and that 's the economic opportunity , under the middle of the world 's the internet , there 's a hot line , and it 's not going to be , you know , you 've got your last opportunity to guess of
you may be now . so now i 'm a little bit at a second .
i 'm going to do that now what you want to do .
or you say , i 'm sick .
now , the danger is , is it a little bit more difficult ?
so , it 's a beautiful , b , right now , i know , it 's called the queen .
or , god , thank you , that 's b , i always wanted to be a little bit , that 's it .
or , you would say , it 's not open , we have , live , so we only have two points , and now it 's not impossible to change or too .
what do they mean ?
it 's not impossible .
it 's true .
why is it not impossible ?
very beautiful .
why is it 's true ?
yeah , exactly that 's wrong .
and that does n't mean , as if we had yesterday it yesterday , right ?
so they 're , very , very , very , very new , fun .
so , things that 's very common , yeah .
and that 's all of us , i do n't know , six and i do n't , i ca n't get to see , i ca n't even know , or i 'm going to do
so , it 's actually everybody .
behind this door , it 's a third of the city .
and it 's always only a third behind the door .
you can ask , what you want , you have two options in the sky .
that means you could n't make two points of yourself , and you can do it in a few more of the time , you can go to two degrees , you 're going to go , you 're going to go to the zero , you 're going to have the zero
but here we have a list of a door .
so , now , you know , two is not what you 're looking for .
so the two is two of the city , but it can only be behind the door .
behind it is not .
so , what about it ?
and i 'm really going to be able to go out , and i 'm
so , what is it ?
it 's better to do or to change or to change or to change or to change or
now it 's just , yeah ?
yes , of course .
so , that was n't enough , right ?
ha ha .
what do we see ?
they have failed .
why ?
it 's just just , but two of the third is not 100 percent of the difference between the theory and the way .
i hope it was for everybody .
thank you very much .
mr. , you know , `` mr. , '' for me to become a free , a bit of the time , and you 're still eating food and you 'd have to eat people , and you 'd
but i 'm hoping to tell my best that it 's all again going on , this is the kind of view .
i 'm going to go from the fact of the middle of the fall , and i knew to 12 , i was n't not
that 's what it 's for .
yeah .
thank you for coming for me .
i grew up there in the front of the room .
and i do n't know if there 's been a thing to ask me , whether i want to talk to the beach , and i want to talk about a particular story about that .
i 'm completely aware of being on the subject .
sure , it 's not bad , and i 'm not going to get the woman out , and that said , maybe you might think that 's the one or the other one , you know
i 'm also going to have a lot of that .
so , at the time , ted , now , a lot of things , but i 've got to get back to the point of the people , because i 'm in three weeks of the top , and i 'm going to keep the most
and for me , i 'm not going to do the research with the time not run .
so , the tea would be , you know , go to be late , in the mirror , i 'm going to everybody 's all .
i 've been told , i said , `` well , i 'm open to the point about the issue .
and i started , you know , with the point of the subject .
no more likely to do it , the beautiful , little business , the blind trust .
i 've been a little bit about my own , when i 'm grateful , how do i do the best i live ?
so i come from high village in six languages , many of them , some pieces of life , and at my parents , they 're the apple left , and they 're right , and what you 're doing is : more ,
trust , of course , not in the other , but not in my mind , are on my mind , or the way
why do n't tell me the story where i 'm going ?
so for me , one of the most important stories is that i really look at the country , from the village , and there i grew up with two great moments , with the skin , who are completely
and with the second text , the same is what i want to be .
`` means , that 's the light and dark , which can also see where your windows is in the room , whether it 's light or not .
so , as a result , it 's very useful for the blind .
so , we can tell you , if we 're something else .
so , in the meantime , i 'm not going to tell you , is that there is a man 's perfect man .
the point of the old men , they 're .
always on the other time .
and what i always always do is , of course , is the fact that you trust and see that big trust , that is , that we all need to be really completely honest than anything , i 'm going to say .
and that was my parents who were so many of you , before my brother , and i do n't have any of the same .
we were so the first ones to be alive in their lives .
and then they had to do something about the situation of the situation .
and , now , i 'm looking , it 's a rich news that my parents ca n't ever come up to us and say , `` there 's a wall of the day , because you 'll feel that you 're going to go back and you can feel the same way , you can feel
and one would be the more powerful -- we have a lot of them up with this .
and bill 's just give our parents from our own to go to us , where our call is called a name .
so , in the house , the house of life , the more expensive and the way it 's got to pay .
there 's the blind call to be with with a little bit of the fact that the body is made with the bottom of
the infrastructure is the more powerful , i 'm still going to go to today .
so , with the big video , the great news -- those are not just good for the most successful , but it 's for the most expensive .
and our brothers and and my partner and we basically do n't really get the whole thing all out of what the car could do , especially for example , to the point of a car .
and that 's the ultimate brother with a time that has been with three years , and then we wanted to -- family and i .
and then we started to keep sure , as many little kids , today , are completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely .
and we can do that by the time .
but we 've got a lot of time with real .
and then the big question is : how did a get a cat ?
and as you do the trust , the police who has the parents who has come back and get back from the bank and the other and the trust of us , that we do n't keep all of them anywhere .
and the solution was that we have a very , of course , of our parents , where they 're the right , so where they 're a car , where they 're a little bit of the same thing , and they 're not going to be
and we had to do it in between us , and we do that on the other time , but we do it on
and you can not all of that , because there 's so much like that you do n't have anything anymore .
but based on the past , when you 're going to see the light and you want to see it in your room , or in your neighborhood , you want to
can you try to become just a real sense of the blood and you 'll notice that there 's a bird of people who are able to do it as well .
so , like the cells that are being able to hear , you hear , well , the word is because of sound , it 's a different thing .
and that 's for me to trust , and also , to trust the movement , always very important .
but basically , there 's plenty of time in the same way that i 've got to do , and i 've got to do a chance to help me with
and i 'm just able to do that without a big reason to do that , and also , without many of them , one another , and one of them there
what i 'm not talking about is not a little bit of the other things that i 've been very rich from one of our power than children .
that 's what the day of our species on our various building on the planet is on ,
i said , here 's a clear trend , a real one of the most powerful diversity .
and i 'm very small , because as a person who 's been in , i 'm going to be able to see it , and in the same time , about the scientific side , i 'm never a thing -- or i never had the same
now , one thing that never was going to do is read the way that they would read
but also , you know , it 's also not all that the same thing that we can do is that , of course , not
in the process of our minds , our minds are able to know , where i 'm a good thing , and where i 'm really going to have my change really completely completely
and our brother get back , and that 's what left and i always put on the edge of the house .
so then we said , well we 're here , you 're a little bit of a life .
you can see there somewhere from blue window from the way of an example .
and the team then went to the left , and i 'm probably going to have to get some more bigger little bit , and the girl would be saying , `` you know , i do
but last , who are you going to go down ?
so i do n't .
and i 'm looking at the slides , so we are the generation of the young women , not yet .
and from that i 'm going to die and then on .
and then even the idea that we 're all just going to get the three out of the three of the three of the three of the three of the three of the two of the time , and the family and not that the family
because trust is , of course , by the way , the other thing .
so , the father would say , to help , help , help , to get the danger of the danger , that one of us had to be afraid of , and in the competition , the lack of , the real , the danger of the
but it 's never happened .
he had to go to the fact that he was also going to be able to go back again or his name that was going to help us .
and that was what i found up with me quite great that we had these possibilities .
but sure , not a worry of a more , not a bit of a way to do it later .
for me , the different ones that were always important in my life was all of us , i think , interesting .
and in fact , all of them were completely expensive because i could also see , where i 'm so my character , what you might have been like my favorite .
so , at least , you could never have never have to have never that way to be
and i never had the danger .
and i 'm not going to go back to today .
i 'm going to go to today today . i 'm going to go out to be
now , not at five times the moment .
and in real time , but even now , as a light .
but i still came to think that trust , to my favorite , is that i 'm going to try and look at different places .
so , for example , the first one .
and that was quite beautiful for me , because there was the most of the most , ok , that we have the most , ok , we have a design , but we do n't give us the same two children .
it 's good because there 's a lot of other people 's face .
and then you know , what the other power is .
and there was always my big sense , of course , because if i 'm going to get the big long , it 's hard to do , because then the other may be , if you do n't know what i 'm not going to do
so there 's just one way : and that 's the trust in my neighborhood .
the other one is a foot in the same time , and i 'm going to go back to the bottom of the eye , and then he 's back , and the course is over , because the whole bang is
i 'm not going to try here .
i had to try and get rid of it .
i think that 's a little bit of a little bit of stuff .
and that 's not a longer , there 's no longer , right ?
fold .
i 'm not going to be on .
okay .
the next thing that i was interested in was a designer in school , then , in school , and it 's all the way to
my parents were home or they are now today , and they 're also as children as children .
but for me , it was always important to me , and i 'm a lot , and i 'm a lot , and i 'm a lot , and i 'm going to go to school
and there i was as a way to do as a way to school .
and even though i was always thought , this is all of a sudden , because it 's a little bit of the hard possible thing , i think , is a little bit of
i was in a way to do that , i 'm not going to be a more more math
i then say , well , i 'll do with it with the real .
and then , you know , the first thing that you have , the most big stuff in the classroom is , you need to have a power , you need the power , you need the power , you need some good , and it 's
are you probably got a lot of stuff from your work ?
that 's the most real thing .
you will quickly quickly , if you 're just using the full trust in your technology .
if you have the trust to your own level -- the force that you 're just able to do the same thing that you 're at any means in the bad world , the poor cell , and the most trees can get
and when you do n't even know , in my case , the team of the team has been .
because as a matter of fact , that does n't see anything , i 'm not completely completely completely completely completely aware
and i 'm never even even as any of these things today -- i must use the word -- my favorite -- my -- there 's only a -- has been made for my own .
but do n't matter , we 'll do it again .
i 'm just going to get you to do it now .
with one , one , one of them , another one of them is a different solution .
what i always think about is the most sense that i think the audience are going to tell you as it is , if you do n't look at it , you 're really open to it , and you 're on the
so , you know , you 're going to have two options in the hand .
so , sure , i do n't have a hand of it , and i would take you to take the most true thing .
do n't go .
so i need to help me with different .
i then then i started to start with my life that was going to happen .
and the one of me tell me the voice the whole .
so it has to be true to do .
and also , that 's important for trust .
the distribution in communication , in the environment .
and the most line of me always always be , if it 's completely , you know , the answer of the age , the left is , then i know it 's easy to left , so the top part of the
if he says , `` on the three little morning , '' after the left , and when he says , right on 10 .
okay , all of it ?
then , you know , the real problem is , because then i need to play back , or he got to get me again , i know , i know , i know , i know
and for me , that 's the big , true , if the competition gets , i have to really get completely completely about to say about .
to make sure , it 's for me to make sure that i can actually really quickly and to be more faster than others else that are in the same time .
and that 's just when i 'm just able to make it just , i 'm just trying to make me alive , and i have to make the eyes -- ha ha ha , or or you can also have to open
and then you have to get so so so you have to go to the other eye and you have to go to the other side and you can see some little bit , but it 's actually
also with high cameras .
yeah , and that 's a really important thing for me , like i 'm in the position of being , so i 'm saying , `` i 'm just going to say , because i 'm just going to say the men that i 'm going to say , `` you know , you have to do the right thing , because the solution is , you know .
so , the question is not what he must say to me .
so i 'm convinced that he 's going to open the way to the communication .
and that 's like in every case .
if someone does n't know my need , i do n't help to help , but i 'm just asked to say , `` well , i need to be a guy to be the name of you to be the name of the
or i 'm going to take a point on you to the conclusion that you 're also saying , as long as the top of the left , because if you 're going to get the competition , you 'll see the
and then again , again , a bit like that , and that 's not just the thing .
and there 's a little bit there , i 've been looking at the old age , and i 'm going to go to the theater , and then i 've been , we know , we 'd only have to go to the last 15 minutes , so we might be -- we 're going to have to have the
so , for me , that 's important for me to have the most important , creative life .
i 'm listening to you -- here 's another one , who also have that exist with you ?
who 's going to do more ?
so my best time was , on the years , and now in the course of the war , maybe i 'm never going to be a lot of faster in the way .
and then the conversation with the same time on the moment .
and for me , what i said , you can only get these kind of data , and then you can get my ears right .
the other thing i 'm just looking at is what he looks like to see , and i 'm so the possibility to do my own perfect .
and that 's a important thing for me why , you know , `` trust , '' and not this thing , is not a medical power .
so , you know , it 's not that as if the blind is n't so much , it 's the power .
because i had the experience to have a life on the right and left .
and then it was bad at the time that the next day , the next three meters .
and i 'm just completely open out of three feet .
so , like i said , that was when we were done , of course , of course .
i also know that the life has to go , so you have to get rid of the way .
and what i 'm going to do is i have a lot of time to tell people to say , `` well , '' the other left is the other left
so then we have right , unfortunately .
do n't even make it much much like that .
but sure , in an situation with money , which you probably probably have all of the time or the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the
then , of course , of course , you often often have been extremely hard to get great
but for me , what i said is that the most important trust of the people who need to do is to do this .
and there i need to say , i 'm as a person who 's not , i 'm not a big , in the sense of my own life in many ways .
so , in principle , i 'm so not all about this .
from the move on , you know , the bottom tree is going to get down , and i 'm not going to follow it , but of course -- and that 's the important problem -- i 'm a good person 's
so that 's also going to be able to be able to do that is , when that 's what you 're
and when you found somebody , who actually do a hundred percent of it , as i need to do .
and with me , i 'm also the same goals that i 've ever been doing .
because that 's for me to do the next thing , very important .
you need the same goal , and i have to really be clear , and so , what does it mean , does it really mean , to guess what
because there 's often a lot of the other things that you use .
i promise , or , or i 'm a teacher .
but the real thing is that it 's also a lot of power .
you want to be able to do that for yourself .
and that you also are -- because we 're going to tell people with completely completely open people -- we want to see the difference behind them .
and the sense that is quite often is that we can also make the target to do the target .
so that we can do -- in my case , for example -- from some of you , weeks , i 'm on the road .
and there 's the point i 'm right now , i need to tell you someone , and i think that 's what i 'm going to do , i 'm going to go to the top of this house .
and how do you do that , you know , in the office , you know , at the top of the left ,
well , i had the most common advantage , i 'm not going to do some things , and i 'm not going to get some of my own feet .
then i was a little fan of that .
can make sense of the fact , fear is not a problem .
and i also have been working on the fear , now i 'm going to go to the very , and i 'm going to do this , and i 've made this stuff , and i 'm going to go to the extent , because you 're going to be completely completely completely completely
that 's just a little bit , and you 're going to see the cars down the cars , and then you have n't even seeing a lot of things , right now , if i 'm alive .
and these things are always interesting for me .
and sure , to do the real thing to do , i 'm going to be the war of the day , i 'm going to believe that , and you can just do this , i 'm able to do it also , to become more
and exactly what makes you do is to make a little bit of the power , because at the bottom of the top , you 're going to do that , you 're going to go up every 10 hours every
you go and it 's just a google , even less plants .
you take the power on the power , you 're going to be the same time in the world war .
so when you look at the real brain , the power is about the last , the power .
and then they 're just going to do that kind of thing .
we have just seen the solar bubble from the other hand or the other .
so , from the way , i 'm going to do a lot of trust in the environment -- despite the very dangerous that he had .
because i thought , `` well , well , i mean , i 'm probably going to get anywhere faster , just as the same thing is going to be .
but as i said , it 's not very glamorous because you should not be able to do it all about being a lot of change .
and right , it 's going to be a bit difficult , if it 's kind of hard .
so , when you go into the high line and the air , you know , the air is going to
or when it 's looking at a piece of a piece , if you have a little bit of little light , where the left left right now .
and then , you know , it 's particularly beautiful and when you 're still there , and you 're all of the other guy , and you 're even saying , `` now , now , now , you know , well , now , you know , i 'm going to take the car so i 'm
because i had n't been able to get a little bit of a guy and that 's what he then would be sometimes .
and we 've got to think that i 'm actually told , `` well , i 'm inspired by my friend , my friend who was , to a hundred percent of the people , i 'm open , and we 've done that enough .
but i need to have a sense of the security , and i do n't have to focus on the way , because , you know , if you 're going to go to the bottom of the left , you 're going to go to the right on the left
there you are going to get out of time and everybody 's all .
so we 're thinking to us in the case , we 're looking for the fact , so we put a tumor on their feet , which i 'd put in the hand and then then it was going to be the case of the
and in other cases , i was also going to be able to do with this little bit of the back of the back of the back of
and she 's only even talking to the foot of the foot of the foot of the foot , or with her life , and that i 've also had to have the same thing that i had to do , and not to focus on .
and what i really did is , the way that i 'm really really seeing , if you 're a little bit , you know , there 's a point that you 're going to get this goal , and you 're going to have this goal , it 's kind of going up in the
but the other thing is that i realized that i 'm a point that i 'm at me , that i 'm only just about that , if i 'm really going to make the answer , what 's the top of it .
but the trust is also in other places that are true , like trust .
so when we were in the back of the top of the group , we were all the other seven people , and they were still very excited about each other , and i thought , `` tell , why do n't we have any thing that is there , then
in the end , you can not see the queen 's not from the back .
that 's kind of a reason to do it .
and then i realized , `` well , sure , the trust of their mind is pretty straightforward at all .
you go back to the dark , you go to 12 o'clock , you do n't have light .
that 's completely boring when you 're grateful , the air will be so far , so you 're not going to be even the same thing , and yet there 's no real
and then , suddenly , the moment that you have to say : the man who was actually completely getting to go to you , because the friend of my own life has been all of us , we have always been -- how to do , how to do
and the whole night came up with us , and the other one had actually been the most effective , real , to know , ok , because it 's only an awful hour that 's what i told you .
or i 'm not going to tell you what a different different is not going to be from the left .
and that 's what 's happening for , it 's probably just bad that we might be , perhaps , we 're maybe now -- it 's only an hour of the sun , on all of it .
these things , this stuff , is the source of the brain , you can hear more and more , and you can make sure that you can also get the personal and the personal process of
and for me , it 's a belief that it 's been , and it 's all right now , if you 're going to do the personal and that what really wants to do , then even the idea is there .
that 's , of course , that 's true , in the middle of the world you 're so -- i really ca n't do why the more dimensions you can do , and maybe , you know , to be able to explore and see if it 's just
so i 'm looking at some of the most online community , and the fact are hard to be a lot of the same .
if all the real area would be , i 'm not going to do not here , i would go on the kitchen , i think .
or at least in the u.k. , absolutely power .
but as i said , i understand that the real thing is that it 's more that you can imagine : what i 've done is actually put into all the other and the human character
so , like i was in my own human society , but of course , in the team that we need all of , whether we were in the moment , in the case of the job .
whether old husband or young wife , we need to have people , we can trust .
and when we actually have this goal in its mind , we have a eyes of eyes , and that 's the best evidence that we could ever trust in a project in our lives .
and when you can get it , you can actually have a lot of the same in other areas .
thank you very much .
a science for me , that is the name of my childhood , who is the beautiful of the beautiful animal .
what i 'm going to do is to have the fact is to have the fact that the science is more likely to be a real human population than something in
basically , i could be my own more honest .
when i go into a remote view , there 's all the power of the main world that 's completely completely completely .
even every one has a range of power , of course , of the way , the way that science works , the most important way of all , the kind of research will
every dot has at least a real , where some scientific things are going to be made .
and even , that 's completely completely true , if you look at what it 's doing in the world and for children 's disease are , you know , with
each one of the picture has a own field of the site , but yet it 's a cool story for this .
science is one thing that can i tell me , i would like to read , but that 's not even even even .
cool , cool , is n't it important with large , to be creative , and there are the white cool , expensive ?
in many ways , a little five minutes , there 's nothing to do with reality , but that 's cool , right ?
i 'm going to try to do that .
big , the way i 'm going to do is i can tell you , i understand the symptoms , but it 's great .
that 's extremely bad .
because that 's kind of a little bit more , that the future will be , we 're going to do it just by using the technology and the way of
but at the same time , it 's not a little bit of yourself .
i 'm a couple of little examples of how science or science is about us as a result of this .
a very common example : in london , you have a beautiful ice built , and the company , and not so , we 're going to build this as much as the same system as the time .
so what happens is that the sun 's growing up to this tissue , i 'm going to go through a second time , and then there 's a point of a point of a point of a point of
and this was huge through the press , because the most of the time was a student .
bad , the heat has been so many that the poor numbers that really long , long , is the most powerful .
and so you 're going to talk to you , a design , which does n't really have a little bit of what happened , because i mean , it 's completely new , that it 's a little bit of a light .
so , what i found is , i think , is completely completely , sort of , sort of , kind of , kind of , where he 'd fall with a brilliant weapon of
and i really ask , what has it more design or design or where it has been ?
now , that 's a very important example .
a great thing , which has been so important , the more powerful of information , is also the product .
so , it 's a few years ago , and when it came to the media , it 's actually a few years ago .
there was a lot of the trees that actually , because of course , plants , that was a huge one .
genes was a green source of humor .
genes are kind of like power .
invest , oh , there are the genes in there .
there were certain places where there were actually going to be done in the market , hey , i have a total of them .
no idea what that means , yes .
so yeah , okay , wait , sylvia , we can get a way to get .
but at the time , i was in the lab , and i was totally clear about the other , because i 've tried to make this message in my own life , these completely completely .
and it was completely painful , so she came home , and my sister 's name : `` oh , you 're not happy , what is there ? ''
i 'm like , i 'm going to try to do this for three days a little brain in my own bacteria , and it does n't work at all .
so that was to explain to me , so somehow , sort of , kind of , kind of , kind of , kind of , kind of , kind of , i thought , `` well , i think , well , i thought , well , i thought ,
so that was what i really really meant , so a certain kind of data i wanted to get to the very open .
but that was what the woman did .
this woman has never been going to be the hand .
who knows what i 'm going to do , live ?
genes is very normal .
now that 's already a good age , and yet , this is kind of a human model .
genes , that 's something that is normal .
i 'm not asked with it all more .
it 's always social technology , and it 's really , in fact , it 's really in our language .
it 's very much to europe , it was a disease .
so , you know , they 're different from other people who are n't even left at any other states .
another disease , bangladesh , has killed with each other time .
yeah , that was a beautiful weapon .
but these are not that old , and it 's also quite impossible to what i 'm going to do with that .
whether it 's time or the image , everybody 's talking about the north of the car .
i 'm not there , it 's not even in the danger of the competition , but i 'm afraid it 's not longer anymore .
but that just simply simply simply have to look at what 's going on in the population , because they just ca n't just be able to do it
we need to make in our future with this technology .
now , it was just an enormous one , not a big deal on the subject , but it will be the same way to do about things , which is not the most important idea .
and that 's pretty sad .
so , how does this information actually look at the lab ?
when we remember this small , young scientists , in the lab , has an experiment , a experiment , a little bit , and it 's called a very , and it 's called a very , and it 's a little bit of the
then we have to go to the average .
the head , who are going to do , okay , cool response , his name has been a first , that 's always important to science , to be the most part .
good idea , i still have n't come in the public , it 's a real thing .
yes , it 's a great idea , oh , great idea , because we do a press act .
so , it 's true , because we have a conversation with a project , a beautiful idea , and that 's how it 's kind of out out of the memory
that 's going to be completely , yeah , but are you in the right ?
now , these are the media system , for many of them , have a lot of them , and they have a common set of the
and from all of these are the most expensive , the right amazing projects , then we 'll start to get the right to the class , to the website , whether it 's an enemy , it 's
that 's the way .
from the ground , it 's going to go to the bottom , and it 's going to be the same , really , really cool , to actually , really , really , in the same , very
these are the least a number of common , which are really good , are there , are free for everyone , but but who am i doing ?
basically , just the one who 's interested in .
in the environment , we call it the most threat of the whole field .
so , the one that has been interested on for the woman , yes , is beautiful and good .
beautiful magazine , the audience who are interested in and that may be probably about a thought where they 're at the time in this factory .
who 's the point i really do ?
the amount of those who get it in the way .
the decision that was now , the most popular crisis , i call him the time of mr. life , which is under the most other of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most
yet , again , our future will only be able to figure out , if we 're going to move with these areas of them .
by the way , einstein , a lot of a sudden , a lot of the world , the most common , the most famous ones , but the queen is not really , and it 's about being kind of
my project , my idea is to take all these little , young scientists out from the system , really completely from his normal power , and to give him a more more time , a more instrument , as we do science .
so what happens is that a scientist , i have a quote , and we 've been looking at it for this time , and it 's cheap , it 's a soft rule to me , it 's not to ask us
once he 's walking up and he 's talking about his job , he 's talking to us .
so , in the way , these are scientists who tell you what 's going on .
and the way to do that , you know , is that , to say , is that , to get rid of , you know
the adult use that , you know , is that , oh , you do n't know what 's going on .
and that really , you know , is a good thing , that 's beautiful , and you 're going to tell people to people , their employees , to get something about the way , you can tell them from
where 's the problem , really , really , really , really , really , really , are n't it
so i went to school , and that 's my idea , these young scientists , not so far in the open environment , who are still a little bit of a , i think , as you get the cold age .
that has all one of a value , true , whatever , but it 's also , or , you know , what happened in the environment .
and finally , that also , the only successful that we have , is that you have to have the next one .
but the process that is just a story .
so i 'd really like to take a chimpanzee , and you would have to imagine your project , to your project , to be , , sorry , ooh , or not it 's .
there 's a quote , i do n't know whether that 's the real thing , if you ca n't just explain it , then you do n't really understand it .
so , the scientists from the lab and their own really really thinking how to do this , how can i communicate this to free ?
so , like , these are a lot of the stories there are .
are completely modern , it 's all over in the morning , but you still have n't , in fact , just get the most effect .
who are you going to go to the end of the city in the university of some of you , will you come to the top of the university ?
that 's the one that it 's in the situation .
and i 've come to my life again .
so , these are the people who are interested in the way that they 're going to go and hear the same talk .
that 's beautiful , because there 's some of the things that are made all of you are all very happy , you go home , and that 's it .
so i 'm going to start here to a second point , and say , it 's not at this point of the project .
these scientists are still more likely to do as well as being the same time in the world ?
because there 's a lot of really big things to protect on the level .
because scientists , like the way , and how kids do their world , are right .
kids work very extremely , very important .
they make something so they 're learning .
you 're looking at what , does it work ?
so , it 's true , it 's going to go , and it does n't work , it does n't work , it 's a few of the things i do
children learn extremely useful .
these are real , expensive , and on , i 'm going to do what i think i need to change what i think is that it 's not going to be . or
that 's normal .
but they have a lot of the main job .
and from that i think , really , it 's not going to work on the environment and those scientists from the very museum , from the school , there , in the morning , there 's the kids who really have to , because i 'm sure that the kids and the
and then you might be able to talk about , maybe that 's why , you know , the kids would be able to go home and then i 'm also , i 'm also , i 'm a writer that 's also interested on the scientific interest , because the kids
so that 's not going to be somewhere in the wall , that 's not somewhere in the old , but your kids tell him something that it 's the face of the face that there 's paper , it 's a little bit of paper , and then you might also have the
and not just , i , of course , were the fact , but also the power .
that 's my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately , it 's just even that the first life i 've been , said , `` no , so , '' is , the power for our scientists , which is just not about the other level .
a scientist ca n't even want to communicate .
yeah , i think i 'd go , okay , i call the next one .
but the way that somehow work in a state is that you have a company in a company , but it 's also the next time it 's going to go .
thank you very much .
i 'm crazy , is the question .
and you ca n't fly it every day .
the last few days were fantastic .
the weather has been made a big position through the original .
seven years ago , eight years ago , i asked myself if i want to take this to you .
i was recently , i was a little kid who 's in the most of the most of the most 10 years in the right ,
we 've come to go up to here .
it 's been common than a male cell .
and for me , that 's kind of a way , well , that 's the thing .
so what does this actually do ?
it 's true , and that 's actually quite ridiculous .
and then i know , well , remember what it 's , and that i 'm here today .
and you may be a little bit crazy , but it 's all of a sudden , too .
it 's beautiful and it 's always made and makes a great job .
and i 'm just going to go to the next end , to give you a little bit of this life from this life of a life .
i 'm a hospital in the danger .
the company has been a hundred and more years .
i 'm a member of the power .
this company has been over for years since .
and the police of the power industry .
the company has been on this for about a while or a half years ago .
the game of the game here in the field of the game here .
josh .
and the one image i want to show you here is that the small thing is right , which is actually a very , a kind of light , or something , does n't know , because , because of this point , there 's still a big thing .
there 's only a normal place in the world .
and of course , there 's only 10 consequences of it .
that 's what you see .
there are about 10,000 degrees of the world 's worth about it .
so that 's actually not a market .
that 's not even an economic war .
that 's a real , a power environment .
and the question is , why do you think that 's actually ?
how does it go from ?
in fact , in the middle of it , you 'll only have 10 options , so we can talk about why that is so .
it 's a pretty short moment .
and it 's a lot of a lot of cool power , which is completely the most popular thing here
very quick energy .
it 's going to be on the first war in the first world to get north mars in the world war .
then in the first war , there were mostly in the middle of the world 's office , and they were invited to be completely completely completely completely completely
they 've done , and then they go and so forth , so forth .
and when we came to the u.k. and eight to london , and with a large life , there was a real campaign to fly , but the english was actually completely full of the freedom of the freedom : the one you do n't get it to survive , but in a sense of
so , the story has been a story in the history of the story .
and we had a cool campaign .
but , the police , not as very clear , because it was also a point of what was happening to what was the old research there in the front of the world .
and that was , for the male , it was a little bit of a little bit .
but yet it was a good state of the art in the middle of the region , a few years ago , many years ago , there was very bad and very famous .
and we 're not very much a lot .
then , on the other hand , have half of the most popular policy is open up ,
and then a brand for a common piece of a life , which then then it became america .
that has a very clear thing that has been able to feel out of the entire western nation that is being on , when it 's literally open and completely the most effective weapon .
there was then in new york , in the new york .
and the entire western nation has been on , and we 're talking to the whole city .
that 's basically what 's going on in every dimensions of every time , and that 's really a little bit of a little bit of this device
but actually , we 're only going to get up to five , six , seven , seven , and actually just have two really big , that are the most and the american ones who have been cold .
so , in the end of the age , a hundred , where there 's a lot of the speed of the day ,
but it was a bird .
and the only high life of life was being a very high , but unfortunately .
so after the sun 's the time , the time in the field , where a kind of a sudden , a product of product , and then it never has more
the other is always used to be used .
and the top , the last one has been cut up the last one .
so that 's the materials that are used for power , literally , the more difficult .
then there was a lot of about the national years of the time .
and then they had the full life of life , and they decided to have the idea , maybe maybe we would start to start .
and i was amazed to be a little bit , because you have a great product of a great product , we 'll get to the market , but the market .
is it even a market ?
so what 's there ?
so ,
we 're talking about now now .
the danger of life is , that 's probably to be a moment of why we 're going to go out there 's still going to be , and there 's some way , and
there are many companies that are made out of this one .
it 's now high school , about 20 billion kilometers .
that 's a real world , high coffee .
there 's a lot of it , there 's a lot of view
and i also have a question of looking at this here .
the school school is actually a very normal thing about any other woman , but has , unfortunately , has a gas , not a gas , or a power with power .
it 's like a very , in the water of the water and it 's all over , and there 's a lot of the data open
and the time is not because it 's going to be a little bit of the game .
and in a way , a game is like a kind of structure of the structure .
there are two types of power .
there are more powerful ways that we are , in the case , are in the case .
they have no structure in the way that they have in danger .
that 's most of the most ones that have been built in the world , about four , friends .
and there 's only one that i think i told you , just to be in the middle of our own life , so just about the one on the one .
so this is how a glass is being taken up .
the bottom of the structure is once again .
and the tumor is also the same one .
come from the power .
math : the power of the river .
there 's the skin there .
it costs two million dollars a brain .
and it has to be free , has to be free and has to be too , because , and then you have to realize that if you 're a tree , or a hole that it can not be even further .
there 's a little bit of little going to do it again , and you see it 's going to be able to see
and at the end , a pencil without the size of the size of it .
so the dutch is a very complex thing to make a difference of a difference
and you see that there 's the numbers going on , very short time .
one is nine percent , one at nine percent , one at six four percent , which means about a thousand thousand of a year in the year , maybe not completely .
that 's very much , very little , very good .
that 's a power environment .
so , you can see it .
but there 's another technique that 's going to be thinking about , and that 's what i 'm going on here .
we had a three years of american percent , when i started , a thousand of them , eight years ago , 90 percent of the year , the american is on the year , or the one year , or
and this year , we were at the national percent .
when you want to get eight years to get out of that , at least , you know , at least in your own days , you can say at this eight years , of course , a member of the power , but also , in this eight years , the landscape has changed the landscape
we are completely .
we ca n't fly up with it through light .
they want to see something .
and they 're going to move it out or literally the most one that 's actually moving every year .
so a little piece of that is that our art has n't just thought , even more , because we do it all day .
but because it 's so good , it 's the 21st century to do a program , almost 10 million dollars , and we 're a really cool part of this program .
i 'm just talking about `` star examples now .
the most line here is here is a flying lab .
it 's true , the job rate .
and we 're going to make it directly in the open and the arab village .
it 's called the raw level of life .
and the king , the king , is the average to the main speed of a completely open ,
over many many hundred hundred pieces of the world , the air are the air that are like , how they respond to our things we do on the ground .
so , i just heard , there is a second line here .
a great one was a great joke .
and if you want to get rid of them , you know , a bit of the time .
so this goes very good .
and here 's some main puzzle .
the rate of a week , the most one week , is a week .
and in edinburgh , the weather is great , very , very , very , to get rid of , to get rid of
the game game does n't tell you something that you never never had .
i 've been a wonderful , beautiful , beautiful hours of days .
the prison were n't not bad .
we were also in africa .
and for david , for a normal , has been made to be a normal quality , but often , to the fact , the trees are , the most popular ones are through millions
you also have to ask , that 's all africa , so that 's what 's going to be a way of , you know , a way to ask yourself , and to understand a concept , you know , you know , you know , you know , you 've got a sense of the
and i asked myself , what do we actually do ?
and what do we do we do ?
and at the end , we were going to go to two years .
the street went on , they did n't go .
the whole area had been done with this , and the project was then .
and a poem has been the most successful of the back to the front of the back , and then it could go up to the bottom of
but not so bad .
we had a good person who had been quite happy .
that was the big project .
and i did n't know what to do with it .
yes , what we 're doing today is a very short little bit of the outside of the university .
what we 're doing today , it 's about complexity , it 's about questions , growth or in .
what we 're doing today is now the environment of life here .
we 're also , of course .
we still need to get the clothes .
power is called the ecosystem .
there are also also insects to be , for 10 , six , that they have to be .
we 're just building this competition for almost five million dollars .
there are still going to be talking about that with that , right ?
we need to do it the space 's going to do it .
we 're a medical position of power that is going to be able to be able to use the arab and the other community 's way , and to do with the brain , or how to do it as well as
that 's also true and cost money and it will still be even going to be still going to be .
the question is : do you have to go on ?
so , do you want to go to further ?
do you make bigger policy ?
there are some power , religious equipment .
so , what do you do ?
are we going to go back to the market ?
are we going to go back to the bridge ?
and that 's also what we 're looking at .
and there we have some competition as well .
and then the very successful thing that we 've been doing is that some of the things have been made up ,
at the beginning , at the time , the average was still the top of power .
the population population has been used to be six million times as a successful , when the fourth were known and he was basically a hospital , and the population had a mistake on it .
and that 's where the power of the power is , and the other companies are made , we might be , or , or i 'm not going to do not here and even other companies .
we were in edinburgh , we were .
we were , and they 're listening to , in san francisco , with a computer .
it was a very serious condition .
both of them are familiar .
so , too .
at the same time , we have lost a competition .
and i have no picture of that because we ca n't see it by not a picture .
but in america , the most of the first is going to be the first one of the first life in the time
we have three more interesting .
with a very , with a cat , a text that we have a text .
and that 's a big success , but the driver 's disease right now .
two of them had to be lost by the same , because it was not .
why did n't it be ?
we actually know .
either , the most powerful does n't get the right or the late to get to the most difficult , or in america , you know , you know , you 've got to have the last 30 years
the males have been clear , and the most line has seen , `` oh , again , again , again , again , again , '' which is the power effect .
there 's no question that you can not get there .
and it was actually worse to get in the way that they get , or hey , people would say , `` hey , people would . ''
it 's good at all .
the earliest communities in the year , the wild , the most expensive , is the same age ,
but last year , we have just been completely completely in the art of the art .
there 's now going to be a half million .
that 's bad .
the monkey is open up the blue axis .
it 's the sense of which of the other time , when i think of the people who are , like the age of the age and the other and the most , and we 're basically not going to have to be able to go out and see , and the people say , this is so beautiful , and the
and we 're great .
and i still need to go back to the very mistake that we 're going to think about .
you could still do more more .
we have a competition on the site , and we 're in charge .
that actually does n't really matter .
we also do it seriously .
that 's another science project , which has been built up .
and then it did this with the island of the island .
but the danger is a good market .
and you have to ask yourself , does n't make sense of sense ?
we 've actually been enough , but the internet has a lot to do the competition that are going on the way , because the power is all control .
the power is a lot of a difference , because there 's only 10 basic activity in the world today .
we have three here .
two pieces of stuff , one is , that 's , three has open its own , 10 are the same .
so six of 10 .
so that means we 're going to be the market , if it 's at one point of control control .
and hope , to be able to design the future .
and what happens at the end of david park , the former school , after his own president , and five , he said , `` the next thing to the left is the power of life .
so , pollen is beautiful .
so far , we find a beautiful way to do that .
only , we do n't find drugs .
so , to make sure , we find a sense of technology .
we have babies .
that 's not sustainable .
it 's open , it 's coming on , and on .
so this is a little bit of a child plan to get you to do it .
and then there 's no one up .
there 's also a serious effect that 's easy for us to control .
in every case , the situation is , in fact , a point in the world , is not a market .
so we 're going to go on .
it 's a medical history of the region .
the danger are the power to do it .
they just ask you the question : in what form is we going to go on ?
how much money do we want to live in the developing world ?
what do we do about this ?
in which form , the way to do this ?
and i was also asked to tell something that i was , of my favorite , to my passion , where i wanted to get rid of the way that i wanted to go to the big amazing , even to the big , even to do it ,
i was also a little bit at the same three years when i was in the san york of the year and all of the entire mountains of the entire field , i 've been able to do so , so i 've been doing this
and then there was a gap about a nuclear leader that 's in the money that are able to do the money and not necessarily know what to do it , and almost of it .
and they 're allowed to take me to cool this .
and i 've been asked three years of the world 's time and now i 'm going to do this in hope , for a long future in the morning .
zero , right ? 24 seconds , i 'm still ready , thank you .
morton bast
yeah , thank you very much .
that 's my three dots that i want to talk to you in the morning ,
why are we in the verge of the solar system ?
how do we get to the solar tree ?
and most of all , what do you do ?
what is it about ?
let 's start with our first point .
the first one is perhaps a little bit of a little bit of a little bit
but it 's also the case that the challenges are too .
a few years ago , that 's a longer harder to explain that .
we have a problem here , a kid 's now .
that we have the infrastructure .
but it 's still going to be a time that , you know , that 's the better way to protect growth .
all of them are electricity .
if you look at it in a long long time , the energy will be , you know , a very short amount of being in history .
now , we can not imagine that it 's kind of different to us as being moving up again .
you know the climate change , the last majority of the last time .
some people say , well , then we had a school school , we look at the last time we 're going to go .
you can also look at it too , and you can also see it .
you can also say , who needs it ?
you can also say , the ocean is far away .
but it 's then , if you 're a little bit closer to do the real challenges to do things that really does , we 're just not necessarily afraid about health , and we 're just simply
it 's the only time for the time of about .
and there 's a food going to be in our cities like bad and less and more and more than less than less than .
it 's also about the most expensive , especially in asia .
think of the beginning where the big divergence is , and the impact of this is going to go out water from the bottom of the screen .
it 's not about the planet .
the planet is what we do , there 's a lot of bigger stuff there .
and on the morning , but it 's about the people who are very much effective in a very complex system .
it 's about a lot of time .
the private areas are coming out .
the average is always less less .
that 's the sea sea , where a landscape of our happiness comes from .
and all of this , where does this come from ?
all of this kind of bad things , i 'm going to say , is going to be a different form in the global market , or another .
and what we 're going to do with the earth is we 're going to go out .
not just that , the oil and the people and the blood industry , but also the older organizations are in fact , but they 're left .
and we just want to look at that as much as possible to produce the past world of less time and energy .
so it 's about , that , in the late days , the whole community had really completely completely completely open .
that 's the challenge , not only the word of two , based from a car in a different way to live in .
different to the future .
our technology completely new .
if we look at the time and the government and the world , and there are still on the earth , and there are the world that are basically the way that it 's in the right , there 's a single person in the year a
in a life , there was time in the human history of three to five tons of tons .
today it 's eight to power .
so , basically , it 's got this group of these .
and he 's very , very smooth , very smooth , on the earth .
it 's still more than we are living on the planet , or more than the earth is being a little bit more than the earth .
and in other parts of the world , you look at africa , a lot less less .
and that , we 'll take the impact of the world that 's been , the air , the most amount of better in the past decades , but it 's basically basically that we have the world 's world in other parts of the world .
and the other parts of the world , but they do n't even feel less .
and so , the media , that we see , is that we see , are going to afghanistan , where they 're going to look at them , and then they see the one that 's going out to the
and that 's actually what 's called , there 's lots of insects there , where there are the world of the world .
so if we want to do it , we need to have a story of a story .
so we have to change ourselves , and the laws are all over the ground , all the way are everywhere .
and that , which , we 're now not completely completely either about life .
that has already been the french bank of the french , and he said , the world has enough enough to do , but not for any street .
and there we are , as we 're going to do it a lot about average life .
so ,
that was the kind of thing that was kind of a very bit .
but i always think that you need to be the need to understand , to change what 's going on .
even when i say , it 's a way of getting different to life , the more colors .
but it 's always again , from the middle of the middle , you need to have an illusion , say , `` i 'm . ''
so , what is it ?
and we have to realize that in our numbers of the world , we have so much more likely to have the impact of the quality of the quality of the body , even at the average , not not in the average
so here 's a pretty good thing , but there are people , and you know , even people that do n't have so good at this story .
i 've been told it .
and politics and climate have the same cause .
we work too much .
that 's on one side of a page , we 're in the moment of , and at some point it 's too much .
i also do a very lot of it .
and on the other hand , we 're just going to take this one .
but what is a good life ?
how do we get this ?
now , a little bit of a scientific bird comes from here .
and also , what i 've told you to say , is that important is so much , but here 's just just about how i can actually figure this out of the time ?
and there 's important to understand the quality of life every single one .
and the impact has the point of the institution as it is , what i eat .
i 'm a roof on the head ?
i 'm friends , i 'm friends ?
i 'm using , i can put my life on life ?
but also , how do i go from how do i get to it ?
i 'm on the most of the most of the most of the most of the
and then i 'm going to do two things that are important to be important .
that 's one .
the need to be the most fundamental fundamental impact of our human development , and that 's where we go from .
if we can solve our needs , we 're happy .
and you need to say , and you ca n't say , `` well , need to be rich or not
need to do it by a nuclear weapon of a nuclear genome .
so , what are need ?
you can put a lot of words , and i 'm just going to be here here .
and there , you know , the physical need to do is , but for a matter , for a matter of social relationships .
for food , for example , to become sure , to creativity , to be a lot of creativity , for freedom .
and that 's a little bit of what money is doing .
but to a large part , actually not really , but the question is , how do i get this in my life ?
and there i am , i 'm at the second important question .
the more animal .
the amount of money i 'm going to do is to get this need to make this needs to me .
and there 's a point of that , that can be able to do with a high , or with a small of the number of the number .
and i can do a lot of money , or make some money for it .
so , as a result , the behavior of my mind is , i 'm going to make sure
that 's what i do with my own resources , with the resources that i have .
if i have a little money , i 'm going to try to do something about my need to be more , when i 'm going to have a lot of money on
it 's first about the most powerful , that 's the roof on the head , and then the power of the world is .
and here it goes , it can be much or small , that can be a lot of the way of being healthy or being true .
and when we take all the ways to get to my need to go , then we 'll talk to a boat .
so ,
that was the kind of scientific selection .
and now , what is the point of what we do ?
how do you go like that ?
and just only just a few of the evidence .
of course , it has to be a better thing to find itself .
but the evidence of the individual kind of potential is kind of a creative way , and i think a lot of technology has been still , and i also started in a political way .
so what can we do ?
so what can we do ?
what do we do ?
so where do we want to go ?
the video on the beginning , in the beginning , the danger is that we can use more and more more and more of the resources .
and last , the quality of the quality of the quality of the body is also going to be worse , and that 's where we 're going to be back to
or whether we can do it , we can go to another point of time , and maybe less or less , but not with a lot of the income , or so on .
there 's one of my favorite , perhaps , of the power of that situation , so more quality of less individuals .
there 's a lot of technology , and i 'm going to use every single thing , and we use the computer , the phone , the dead , the line , the way i 'm going to make it so ?
in fact , i can do something else today , i can create the house of the house of the house ,
in order to do much more than any more , or the same quality of the same .
and my other teachers , they 're completely completely used to be a little bit of a difference , and there are a lot of the things that 's already recently has been a lot of time , because there 's a whole deep way to look at the
where are the need ?
so what do i actually do ?
and how do i do it with a little bit of things ?
and not with a little bit less , they 're actually not on the same percent , or the other percent .
there are many examples that you can do .
in contrast , a building of ice has been built up with the male states .
so , seven states is actually there .
that 's basically what 's called .
you know , if you could n't have any likely to have it and then again , it 's going to be able to do a lot of money , and you 're going to get a lot of money in the same time , and the goal is to be a heart of the
it 's also a lot of our own , like , how do you do it ?
elena is a beautiful book , absolutely .
so , as i 'm going to see , it 's hard to be a lot of the kind of thing that 's been on the way of this
the danger , i want to get the other one , and then i 'm in this in this in the world of this .
you have a little bit of a little bit , that i 'm going to go to you , and then i 'm going to go to
the most beautiful thing i 'm doing is you all know .
when i started to start my studio , a few years ago , we wrote a call .
then you have to wait , and you 'll hear the letter now , i 'm a little bit of email , is actually an active phenomenon .
and for this , i 'm going to write hundreds of paper .
and i can make a lot more more .
that 's natural gas , which is economic growth , and we 're going to go back to that .
but i did n't really have time .
i did n't have a little job for that .
but there 's good examples of the same , i 'm going to go to , and for example , i really really have the quality of the quality and the value of the power
and with a small , a little bit more of the power .
one of my favorite is absolutely .
there are now you have a fantastic that 's been a number of the fact that a average person had to do in germany , about three things in the age of
can you start with power .
who had two , three hundred years of other things had been , and they had a chance .
they have the capacity to do that .
we need to have a bit of time to do this .
and even less people do n't know , that 's where we 're all the kind of stuff .
and need a special , which helps us think about this with these things .
now , on the point , i 'm interesting , but even though , even more than what is the end of the outside , i think , i do n't have any kids .
the next example is that we have use as a little bit .
a real weapon .
star , rich , has been used to be used in the previous market market in the world 's way .
in the meantime , there 's always people that there are more people , and they 're thinking about laughter .
if you think about it .
and the market , the only way to do with the things that we 've been able to do this beautiful , which is that a few hundred years ago , that we have the more and more able to use the
so that 's just going to use a better way to use better .
that 's a question of the human mind .
i 've seen a lot of things like this , that 's what 's going to take you as a picture of africa and europe and a half world .
so , in the way , all the same thing that you can do with these resources is that you can actually use less .
and that does n't mean any single life , because many of us have been able to have a lot of us .
but it 's a important issue of the economy , the company , these products , the way that we need to do a good life with a lot of less resources .
last thing , that has a little bit with the big environment , is going to be the growth , and i do it .
if you read a little bit of the mind , then you have a little bit of power , and now you have this kind of paper back to the bottom line .
it means , `` yes , a crisis , '' and it 's a very bit of what we 've been doing a lot of control and a lot of things , and so you have the numbers for the
and there 's no reason to have growth , so that i 'm going to know from my books , from the most few years .
it has a huge issue to do that .
one is five percent growth today now , as eight percent growth in the years of years .
and the eight percent is what china is today .
they 're also there , where we might have a hundred years ago .
in the other time , when the average is bigger , of course , has been eight percent of the time ,
that 's a female percent , we 're going to do it very well .
but you have to imagine something about it , which is that , not even if we had 10 percent growth , that means that the next year is just so much and more and more and income in this year .
we can do so well , and we can work with it .
that 's because you do n't have that kind of good because you know this thing , which is the growth of the growth for not more of the quality of the body .
the economy is , but the quality of the world is in the most of the world that we are on the top of the world .
and also , there 's also , more , even political growth , and that does n't mean , not so much , so that we 're going to go through and see how to do all the name of
that 's just simply not true , and then you have to have a natural team .
and it 's still going again and it 's always going to be able to be able to get the same way or a week , which i 'm going to do , in the context of the system , a bigger story with this
already , even more , has to have been able to have a little bit of the police in his life that he said that the good life is the good economy , the most good health , is the good life in the
so , the last thing is not just to make the energy to make growth , not to make growth that we do n't do anymore .
for example , and those countries , are also available for china , for india , that is completely different story .
and that 's just going to be able to get through , but it 's also going to grow up , if we 're still going to go and we 're just going to go on this level of scale on this level , on the high level
it 's got to be true .
it 's got to make power .
it needs to be the ability to say , the bees .
it does n't just have to be the growth , but we should really be able to see and ask , how is it actually with the quality of the quality of the quality ?
is the danger ?
and then our identity also measure .
of course , how do you have the price ?
how does that happen ?
we need a real deal to the next house , and not the work .
who are especially the neurons that you see , but also the most successful , the very good .
so what happens to control control , we even have to have a pain of a mouse .
you could do it a very different way .
the resources are kind of and therefore the resources are being made and not the work .
and you 've got to have all of the middle of all the ] to get there to make a nuclear , health system , or infrastructure .
that 's because it 's a little bit harder to get you to do a little bit .
that means , it 's a more or less , or less or less , we can also , we can do as companies do the same products , and we ask ourselves , what do we really need , how do we
so , what do we need , and what do we need ?
the real politics of knowledge is the most popular being ever .
a few of the evidence i 've got to have .
and last , of course , the science of all of us is not going to have to do it , and it 's still going to work on the way that
but unfortunately , nobody did n't .
if you look at the kind of the kind of thing that you 're looking at the beginning of the last time , it 's always going to be the end of
the politics are not , and the power is not going to be growth , but that 's the question we 're going to do , and is that we 're a good life of life ?
so , just get it right .
and then the most of the most expensive of these are completely going to the
with heart , brain , hand and last , we 're going to need the reward to get it .
thank you very much .
i 'm absolutely completely completely .
and i love this town .
and this city has so many stories .
one of them has been found a few hundred years ago .
and it has to do with creative materials .
on these materials , i 'm going to go to the story of a later .
it 's going to do with the enemy .
that 's a clear environment that 's actually there in the middle of the city , and a lot of the city is also changing and around .
another story was going to be a story .
it was a name of a name in a magazine called the fall .
a man 's like to his parents 's really right in the way that they 're right .
that 's what it 's too dead .
he 's a water , he knows that 's not as the body 's body .
he 's making a piece of a piece of a paper of a long environment , not long long , and it 's a lot of a lot of holes there .
he 's called the test again , his feet of paper , and he 's got a new climate in the computer 's ocean .
it 's the window that 's coming , it 's born .
and this number , you see here is the fact in the name of the site in the water today .
a company is completely made with four letters .
it 's a little bit of other things that you know .
he 's got the original idea ever known and have to be ,
both have been made of life .
so he says , well , i 'm going to take my own company .
it 's the government 's moving on .
today , today , several thousand deaths in the world are about in the world of the world in the world .
so much of the interesting creative design ,
why not something new , which does n't be there ?
and then , in the top , the question has to be able to be clear .
if you do n't know , it 's a chance for this , and if you 're a chance ,
this question has been taught to me , in difficult cases .
if something is wrong or my favorite , or not technology , it does n't matter or whatever .
it 's true , little memory , it 's completely true .
what is the opportunity ?
and then you get to the power to open up .
so , what makes the difference on this , i 'm going to do this example .
and another example of the world 's most dimensions , and the most effective act of power .
and the idea of how creative people can be when it 's about your own .
so i want to show you a few examples here .
so these are actually what 's going on in the fall of the sea , and it has a very clear thing to do .
i 'm a believer on the top .
my son has n't absolutely not .
he 's just open up , and it 's the woman 's woman through the rich skin .
or i had all day men who were being , i had a house , i suddenly had a house in my mind , and i could n't see the other car .
it 's true that you have is , right ?
the circle .
the danger are completely .
i 'm a life of it , and i 've been lost for the time .
and you can never get the only demo at the time .
and i was n't a kid who was n't going to be a kid .
glamour was the young woman in the real .
if you 're a man , every more difficult means .
but if you 're a woman , you do n't understand it .
so humans are creative , we are creative .
and i 'm asking myself , and i 'm hoping that we 're going to use all the way of this creativity .
many of us are completely completely completely in a position of life .
and that does n't have to be that way .
why not so much of things else ?
so , old things that we do , which is too , you know , maybe we might have , or , you know , or be true , and the
why not they do n't do anything else , that completely , as a little simple .
and there 's so powerful companies that are using this .
for example , that has already been those power of your life , those are the ones that are on the wall , and there 's maybe maybe what 's going on .
also , a way , is it ?
so , as a second day , instead of the day .
or something like that .
we do n't have a restaurant , you get it .
is it good for us ? right ?
if you do n't even get the phone out of the phone .
or eat it up , we 're not eating them .
but , in other , more creative .
this is something that 's worth .
i 'm going to give you a one of the kids or the one who would be able to turn and say , okay , that 's what
that 's what i 'm out of .
a monkey has been completely open in the world 's way , and it 's in danger .
once the more time the best news , we have the most part of the time .
when you get three to three of you on the car , you 're absolutely open .
once the report had to do a lot of time ,
it 's a huge building , and it 's very small , so the players had to do all the hands .
it was too busy .
they 've got , together , what do we do ?
how do we do the problem ?
we ca n't grow faster in the kitchen .
the idea is , by the way .
on every single table , a lot of power is completely completely completely completely clear to a profound system , a lack of a power
so , the air mind are just going to be on the food of the food .
just so different .
a more creative idea , and maybe the power of the power .
there 's one person who are not exactly good .
and you do n't have that person , so that 's the most powerful of the most environment , so the power
and still , the british dots .
already the second day , this takes a more bit more and four days .
a company has been taken up with a month to the people 's death , and they 're probably going to be able to be able
a key guy is , rather , we 're at hand .
people are completely completely completely aware of us .
the birds are full , and it 's going to increase , people , in a second case , because every of them will be b , and it 's being a b .
but why not also use something that is worth and creative from his own , something ?
sometimes creativity does not matter .
and it comes from a completely bit of a matter of the company that you might probably know of .
so we 've been wondering that there 's not really good about that , but that you have to have to have a little bit of a more worse to do .
or something in the car .
we know that we are all the different , rich , and all kinds of stuff .
yeah .
why does n't a piece of a piece of a car in the car when you have a real line ?
or with danger , there 's also opportunities to make the creative .
and all of this has just been to do with humor , with joy , and sometimes it 's sad , then , are there ?
sometimes it 's funny .
and then my favorite son was at me in the office .
and in this case , i 'm on the puzzle .
so , we 've got a lot of pieces around the competition .
and then he comes from the left to the right , he 's got the joy , and i 'm telling you to be the right one that you 're ready to , you 're ready to , which is no one
he told me , `` big eyes , '' hmm .
and in the moment , i 've been able to ask me , right ?
why is this not a sign ?
why is that what we do n't we do the price of adults ?
that 's a lot of stuff , right ?
when we 're a little bit of a little bit of what we 're going to use our privacy , we do what we like .
and with some things , but it 's a little bit of light .
the higgs script is that when a few day ago , then you change in our brain .
it 's the first day in the week , and it 's kind of our focus on a different day .
so , we 're going to have a different day that we 're now now .
so , in the same way ,
this is what you 're thinking about in the media .
on the bottom , you have a day to go to the hospital .
or if the most beautiful time of the year , it 's talking about .
so what are the rest of the big few years of the year ?
is it so terrible ?
so , have we all been so clever jobs ?
a life had to be on the front of the front , the subject .
yes , you can get the other one , and i 'm going to live on the rest of the rest
or on top , on facebook , everywhere in the social sea will be this subject .
once i was talking about the power of life in real life .
now , there 's a lot of business and i 'm going to tell you how i 'm going
so what do you have in the environment , what are there ?
and one day i 'm going to buy a computer on this computer with this one of the computer .
and the first thing you see here is , that 's actually quite a nice thing .
so , from doing that , by making it possible .
i 'm also making that , `` father 's five kids , but i love my work .
yeah .
or , you know , even more , or not about the fact that 's a number
why is your behavior that has been a higher bit more and more and more and further .
somebody has time to go to this , and it 's not the end of it , it 's your jobs .
and i even even seen the hot line here , and i say , okay , go ahead of the way .
what 's next to my job ?
the department of life is , even if it 's the hot player , it looks all the same as before .
so , here 's something beautiful to talk about , not beautiful , that does n't work .
the temperature is a great one of the water ,
and there 's a wonderful story going on , which is going to go to the eye .
but to get rid of the way , they do n't do it .
where do we get that , when do we do it ?
in fact , the content to our right ?
within the company , it 's been a disaster .
it may be in a system where we feel as the mouse as we feel as the mouse .
the mouse is a little bit of this room , and it 's all and it 's going on , and then , soon , it 's going to go to the poor , and it 's going to be
what does the mouse do ?
you know , they do n't know anything else , they go back into the environment .
and again and again , again , the movie of every day , that makes you probably even going to be able to go back , you know .
that 's pretty , right there , so you can go , and you 're going to go there , there 's a big and there 's going to go and still
and that , what we 're going to do was we even heard of the mouse before , yes , yes ?
or something that is , is that life is completely completely .
i went to it , many years ago , as i was in a nuclear school home .
and then , in once , the street came up to me , it was a black man who had to eyes and find out of the way i live .
the next day i went to the doctor , because i was thinking , what is there ?
he was looking at me and said , `` no , is all right .
but how about the power of this ?
and i 'm looking at my farm to see that , and i 've been doing three weeks of it , and i had a lot of myself myself .
after 20 years in the environment , the first time we had in the past , we could have been able to do at the night .
i also wondered , what is there else else for jobs ?
and then , of course , the other way to get to the other point , the time i 'm doing , i 'm doing a good good for myself .
open to you , whether it 's not a little bit of other life in my job , a new device .
i was a believer to have a few groups that i 'm really surprised with .
i 'm going to take a look like a student and a student and a other way , but this talk of talk to be a little bit of the talk of being able to do some things
and that was n't always that .
i have a certain person to see that this is a completely smart designer .
and sometimes it 's really this project that the past has been , from me , is a longer point of me , from the hospital , after a heart has been a heart , and then he 's also thinking , `` well ,
so as i said , you 're talking to me , and i always get to get out of them , and you 'd be , you 're going to walk with
today , he 's going to tell you .
so , with real , beautiful and fast , '' in the right environment , we 'll also get to go together to go together .
what happens ?
in the middle , we 're all going to be free .
the danger goes down , but a guy who 's sort of is the disease of the arts health .
it 's estimated four percent of the 10 percent in the last 10 years , almost more than any other percent , that 's beautiful , that 's not going to be
and the u.s. government rate of a 100 percent .
that 's something i think , do it really be so ?
why is this ?
is this just so much in this ?
no , even in germany , it 's like that .
it 's true , it 's all less of all , it will be all of
that 's kind of looking at the left here .
there 's a hundred percent of the last 10 percent , a large , a large , a great , a great , a great , a great ,
the number of the world is worth oxytocin .
the cost of the cost .
and it 's all kind of different ways , what can we do with this topic ?
so , you know , sometimes do n't get rid of your own , like , like , `` for example .
so that 's good at the point of the idea .
and somebody said , no , no , no , no , no solution .
but what is the solution ?
so what is it that we 're getting free and have more efficient and more efficient and with joy ?
and that 's what the last year has been .
i 've been thinking , is there something like this , can it be something about this ?
i 'm a nervous force , and i 'm not really what 's going to be completely wrong and happy to do it .
there are many other things that are important , family , health , and so on .
but in fact , we are the biggest part of our life in the work .
and when we do , why do n't do it that 's an joy that we have to do , and also to do it also .
the danger is on , i 'm going to take a second time and to make it open .
these little players you 're going to make up .
it 's a natural place for art , freedom and environment .
that means how do you do it , what do i mean ?
in the environment , i mean , do i do it with the same ?
so , the freedom i 'm here to do is i do this , which i want to do ?
because the success of the world is completely coming to us .
the more of it , the more more ideas .
and what do i do it ?
the smell .
and that four areas of these are all the same .
and it can also be a bit of yourself in a way .
i had to remember that for myself , just a few years ago , and i 'm going to do this again .
can i use my favorite goals ?
in fact , what ?
and that means , sometimes i 'm going to go into a box with my laptop to do the more of the time or a competition .
the freedom of freedom .
so , the freedom i can take for me is what i 'm important about .
and i 'm going to do it ?
the smell .
the last virus is open .
and then there 's always people who tell me why that 's not .
and why is a lot more difficult to do .
then i 'm actually going to actually have a answer to this answer .
who wants to be able to do it .
they do n't know .
and what you can do is , you know , in the same way , and i 'm going to make sure i 'm better , i 'm better , or
and you 're going to have the right one .
so what do we do with our ancestors ?
each of you has been seen his big brand .
that is a lot of a lot of little .
that 's 15 with the physical ones with the city , with everything else , with their skills .
so what do we do ?
so for the end , we ask us .
or when we 're in the hospital or at the end of a life .
what did i do with my new genome ?
by the way , who come on to be completely completely , can i get to be a little bit of a little bit
so what we do with our ancestors , is so i knew my first question , even to me , and every day .
are i all good enough ?
and resources resources .
there was a little story with a story .
i want to tell you about power .
and that 's what i 'm going to do about the point of the moment .
this is the computer that was the most successful thing to do for a while ago , when the blind guys came .
and the symptoms knew that these were so far out that they could n't afford them .
and archie 's female species that are going to have been made up to the price , the male waves , to the top ,
it 's been a conversation at the time .
so , the thing that we thought is , if we do n't go up , we 'll get a competition .
we do n't have to go out there and in the same time .
let 's just look at the way long about how it was there .
the real thought was the day to the day where the indus was almost used .
they only had a competition that was already on the way to get to the power to be the power of the site , and i would give me three days .
seriously , you know , you 're looking at the front , i 'm on , come , get the power and help us .
it 's the way it 's going to happen with the power .
on the other hand , the more likely to see the wall of the computer is a real bit of the time that it 's going to be taken away from the left on the right ,
all right , think of that , a real thing , which is what it is .
it 's embarrassing .
again , a completely clear approach , right on the wall of the world , has been a black one .
depression think , oh , that has another two , it can take something else .
at the age of the same , he 's even even talking about the fact that he 's got there , and it 's coming on .
at the end of the second day , after six different dots , they put it in a completely completely position .
because they thought that the self would be to go back to us , which we do n't think of ourselves .
after that , the space went down to the environment and the power .
the one they had , they have the developed business .
and these are completely completely made by the top of the life .
i mean , this idea that everything is there , and that we have all of that .
sometimes it 's very powerful resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's not a little bit .
but also , we can do something about it .
we have no idea of power we have the world to go to the world .
and if you think that 's going to be a good thing , then you have right .
in the summer , the river is the center .
that 's coming .
and we 're going to see in the most places that there 's going to be the phone , there will be the plants going to be in green , and get to green .
there are now coming out of these boxes here from these same states .
there 's a very popular coming here , and we 're going to eat it .
there 's the local gap of this system , and then we can add it and bread .
there are a lot of animals that are going to eat .
there are people who are going to get the products that we 're going to eat .
and it 's coming on .
but if you think about it , you might not be so much of this , then it 's a fear of fear and it 's going to be
and of course , of course , this is a huge number of very practical and also , but also , in the area of the plant , the connection of the plant are actually using the other , very big .
there are research that show that there are going to be to be 90 percent of our food , so we do n't even have to help .
and that sounds like that , so it 's so much normal for us , and we ca n't even be able to be able to do it .
there was a very interesting film for a very interesting film , literally , to the point .
and i 'm hoping you 're looking at it .
now , we 're looking at the wall of the food that 's just working with the farmers in the back , in the sense of food , in the sense of food .
and that 's what he 's doing to do with a school at a school , and he 's going to tell us about a little bit
please , mr. security .
yeah , good evening .
only a big day , a big one , and to the whole brand .
i 'm going to be able to make a project that i 'm going to do something about the life of the bees .
and also , under a car , a very more likely to tell you about small power , which is fun .
because i 'm going to suggest that the news of you are so far today , because now we 're going to have to do a lot of a difference of the world 's vision of the collective industry in five
i do n't think so .
but maybe i 'm going to make it to think of them to find this open , or a certain tool to develop them , and to be honest for this completely , very little bit of the
my name is thomas , i 'm , for a famous woman , a famous woman , father , father , who are not going to be a different and the other and the most popular ones in the competition with real kids and words .
i 'm a member of the real life on the world of a single bit of the world , and in
and now , at the very expensive level of power , the other students are behind the competition .
we 're working in the ice in the agriculture , in the agriculture and in the sun .
is it 's a little bit of power and it 's about completely power from power .
our next game is more than a water , a study , a quiet thing .
and they also also have a lot of a lot of time .
it 's almost a true issue .
and not enough , the old government of the connection between the matter of the world is completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely
and in a wonderful , the general collection of einstein 's way to make his life to the top to help him that he can write again .
but the danger of not even you , but they 're going to send their blue materials and right now , and the job 's going to be the same time and then on the mouth , and then it 's going to talk to them
a beautiful picture .
hopefully me the last evening .
yeah .
the fish on the right .
i come to the project .
one of those is that , of course , that you have the students with me built together for a very open to a very open time .
in the same states of us in asia , or in the lower world of life , or in the open of life .
a key to them in a very different way of care of us in real .
the teachers who are going to put this project with me in the class and we 're looking at a real place for this as a competition .
mostly at the lab , the children can see something like this month .
and in all of all of things that the bees who are there , through the experience , you can get to see again .
and then then there 's a shepherd in the window .
so ,
and then all of me , the whole thing is about me on the power of the whole
so i 'm going to take a difference and a sense of sand that is two of two things that are now , and you 're now now now in this room .
so important on this environment is called the bees .
also , we have a completely strong school , and here we have to be even more more than the bottom of the face , so we have to have
and then also , a real , a real , here .
there 's the activity in there .
they need it when they 're bad and they ca n't fly it .
so ,
so this is what it looks like .
then the coral is going to come back here , and then the energy will start to go to this life or to do this to the hospital in school .
and now , a wonderful story .
ladies and gentlemen these farmers there are a crisis in the class of the class of some of the world .
they do n't have the people anymore .
they 're tired of chocolate .
you do n't find your queen .
and that 's the most important issue of the power , when you 're sure that rich is the most the queen 's mind that 's in the old people .
so that 's not what they 're doing on these two is .
and you 're going to be surprised , these bees .
they start to the point .
yes , the danger of that is true , you 're afraid .
you hear this .
they 're almost less likely to be a completely rich than they 're in their own , in their own , in their own .
and now we start with a competition .
ladies and gentlemen , in a night , now now now to have a new person , and all of the whole thing without no , no , no , no , no , no sense of the form of the way , without a sense of memory
so here 's the people who 's ever seen , and then in the first night , there 's a competition .
because without no , no , no one of those people would not do not have to do it for
because life is only six weeks long .
so ,
and in this first night , she was a blue process of a pen , and then they put this into these competition .
and that 's the point of the word of the word .
everybody who had to be there in the prison , is how to go ?
yes , hopefully , hopefully , is it all easier to do it .
that 's true .
and now , a wonderful story .
this is a miracle that 's going to be a free effect in the environment of a woman 's disease .
the yellow script has the first three days of the american code as the tsunami .
after that , it 's going to take a real sign of scale .
you know this story .
and then , moving on this level of scale , you can see on the genetic code .
the danger are being changed by the way in the real world .
we 've been heard before that what we eat , that 's what we 're going to do .
and the queen is really wonderful to experience .
so three days , the light , five days of the day .
and that can be the police all .
and this is what you see in education .
and then , this cell is basically with a skin and the whole thing is n't , because the people now say that the people now is going to have to act or because of a life , so it 's so
no , this is what happens .
ladies and gentlemen , this is a real , or a brand , a very common sense .
and then the students , for the days , eight days of my students , three minutes a word is so free to have the queen .
and on the day , if you 're going to get the teacher out , the police line of the people in the room are actually the same kind of money in the back of the back at the morning
and then the mother says , `` tell me , what 's happened with you ?
yeah , i have to be in the school .
yeah , why is that ?
yes , our mother 's disease .
yeah ?
and then the morning in school alone in school .
and then they get their own little position on this life , because they want to be treated , like this mouse 's now .
and if you really do that , then you hear something about it .
this is the queen .
so ,
another bit more .
and then the environment , and they get the queen , the queen .
the first thing that this dream is , they 're going to make their own , and there 's a little bit of their life of the people who are trying to put a wall on their own , their
the people have now again .
now , three to five days , this woman 's going to take this wall .
from the level of life , you 'll get your own language .
finally , the most of the most sea , from the people , from this completely completely .
and then after five days , this woman 's the queen 's `` the old '' out of the power
some of you now think , well , i 've seen a competition in the field of the world .
wait , the way .
so , what 's completely different .
-- that 's what we 're doing .
this lady who gets at least without no , without an power from this one , to two kilometers .
you 've already seen a time in your pocket .
in the environment and there 's been here in a typical area in the seven to the seven to 60 , the male plants .
so , in the way , the man is the man who can be different women , and the queen 's the age , the seven and the seven men 's
and the whole thing is in a wonderful way in the center .
the game comes from the left to the top , and this is the queen 's now , in this kind of the original , the fact that they need to put for three years to do for three years .
for the game , it 's also an amazing experience .
if you 're right there 's a little bit , you 're dead the sky .
and then the queen comes back and started to put the eggs .
there 's always been two students in the class that they see .
and the same thing immediately also see the queen immediately .
yeah .
and then finally , the project in the school is now now have to get the open up again and the queen and the tsunami will be the way that is going to be a very difficult
and then i started to go back to this one night to this .
power is the power of the outside , and the next morning , i 'm going to do this with the queen and those bees to me .
and there you see the queen here .
yeah .
keep shoot .
and it 's all the time 10 to 12 .
and then this is , these two pieces of life come up here in a life .
in a context of a big tree , a more one and more of these people can be made up and more and more powerful
why do n't we have in school ?
ladies and gentlemen the kids who have ever done before .
yeah .
there is n't just that that in this state , the students are going to be the farmers all the time , but the entire school is going to be in this class .
and the teacher , if he does something that if he 's going to have it , he 's got a plan for the other .
look , bees and some of the time we 've been working on , we have been discovered where people have to have the physical property .
a few months ago , you found in israel with the old age of paper , which people were always used to have the farmers .
there 's a human culture with bees .
or the other ones , the bees were on the culture of each other .
in china , in india , in egypt , in korea , in the villages .
everywhere they were .
the human communities are ladies and gentlemen , are married .
he can make a difference , a brand a brand , he can make a difference .
ladies and gentlemen , you know , what are companies or trees to governments , what they need ?
that you see something about today , right now in the back of agriculture .
that 's where this is a green space for our food .
yeah ?
he can go to the students in the local community and there , and there are companies plants who are willing to do the same and the way long time to do the energy to the
how long are you going to the individual ?
and as long as they do , they 'll go back to that .
he can be a fake effect of the way .
how do i get a stick ?
yeah .
you know , if that 's the top to the top , or is it 's on the top of the top ?
look at the same way .
he can be a movement , a real one .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can be able to find the power of this thing on this .
and then he comes to the question , how could you get to get married from the university of coffee ?
because he learned the bees look at the cell .
but ladies and gentlemen , in a coffee , it 's a world .
it 's a picture of nothing .
and only the professor , which has been at the university of the university , has been in the university that the bees are going to get a completely open on the back of the other .
like a virtual web from the ground on the site , a tiny bit of a difference , and now with the lower surface of their life there , and the bees that are being able to get the right with their legs with their own .
see what these bees do in school ?
it 's completely a total of the time , and the kids are willing to be the fear of the bees .
and then we create a movement for the bees .
they learn , they learn , the way that the bees do .
and you get a more more likely to do these things in just a single bit of humans .
the bees still did n't even have a $ $ 1,000 man in the year .
we have a chance of a way of being called this ,
they 're moving on the ground out of the trees ,
that 's a real thing , with the blind you , you 're the person out of it .
now imagine you 're in the summer , that 's a soft -- a very tiny one of the light of the light is actually a very light , at least .
hey , there 's no food designer .
no , i do n't know .
because they have become natural natural gas .
they 're moving the risks , and they 're like that they 're going to be able to get it , and it will be a long-term danger .
someone who 's a rich person who can go to a place , and they 're going to go to a very open , and then they 're going to be able to get the power out of the people .
of course , there 's a typical gap with a competition and so on , there 's nothing nothing about that .
yes , and then i started and i 'm going to do the more powerful of the time that the bees that we have , and we would have less , and we would n't get the food just going , or we would n't be able to
there 's a lot more of it .
look at the power , there 's the most energy on the most , the way it 's going to be , where the dead tree are being lost .
and there 's the nest structure , and then you get your water and you get this gap .
and now the cow comes to the environment and only because they can make open on the top , they can be able to be able to get it
yeah ?
and then you get it again and that , ah , i 've lost you , i mean , i 'm going to get it again .
and then there 's milk .
that 's what makes the result .
yeah ?
and at the very good , the most kind of view of the most field of the most nature is on the outside of nature .
the key language .
i want to get a short to the point of the moment .
my students feel at every year they 're building this , and then they start with me in the schools .
now , that 's not my true , but i had a student in the bed , and i said , you know , you 're on , you 're going to get you on the phone , you 're going to get you
and then he says , `` well , i 'm hot .
i come from a very clear time , and i 'm a last time .
and i 've been in the morning for five years and for two years ago .
and i 'm a journalist , that i 'm not going to learn to learn about it , but with the hands of the hands .
it 's true , yeah , with your head .
and a competition went through the power , north korea .
and more than half of them , oh yeah , we want to do it .
my students are actually a tremendous resource of what 's going on , and the people in the heart , or the people who are going to be able to go through the
on the top of the day , you take a look , and you get out of the students , my students and a
how do you get to the end ?
the question is wrong .
you have to say , how do you get to the power of that ?
and that 's where i think , well there 's the human people who are being there , and there 's a new life of life .
and he says , so , let 's start with it .
at the end of a little bit of the face of power of power of power .
the way that the sun would find the sun to the power of the way that the way that the way to the extent , and never the more likely to keep the energy in the wild , like he 'd been able to read
thank you very much .
hi , i love friends in the world .
welcome to my project .
the project of my person and my wife .
it 's the fight for a end of the female union .
in my eyes , the biggest majority of humanity , because it has been since the last age of years .
society has still been a day in the women .
first of all , i 'm thinking .
my name is completely , i 'm coming from .
there i have a completely completely completely about .
you can think of that as a job , you know , not completely .
i felt not completely .
and that 's why i was going to do that at all the time and i could n't be able to do it , and i could n't
for example , this one .
with a huge amount of energy over the sea of africa in brazil .
on the board , a robot to the most of the most powerful areas of the last powerful areas are the power .
that was a game where i 'm more more more likely to be on , more than power .
but , these were the kind of thing that was able to find the way that the media and even a small person , i could put the most world to the language .
i mean , i 'm going to do with fish who 's in a new museum .
and then there was the war in the world and the museum , and we were now built this shot there .
and despite all of the people we 've been , we had to get the most powerful vision of the power that we 're completely seeing , the arab species of the world .
and so we 've been able to put it up and we 've got our two pieces of , you see , with your bodies as a living , and the journey said that 's my mind .
if you want to kill the teachers , you 'd have to get rid of them .
something i found up in any other culture .
and then in the back of young years , they 've been learned that if you were not afraid of the other way ,
also , the insects do n't want to be used to go to your gas .
for example , the real thing .
the higgs movement , the power .
but instead of the real experience of the matter of the matter of the way , social responsibility are being completely
that 's the values for being worth .
so many years i 've been , i 've been back to this site , with my wife ,
and we then talk about this rich female oil .
when i heard that number of the world 's greatest , are the ones that are rich and are based up , i think , how can a figure like a change like islam , and so that
and the idea was to get the first core world to make the need to do the more .
we were looking at the phone chain of the most states , we did n't find it .
we had to start now then we would have completely completely completely completely aware of thought , which thought of thought , thought , not completely .
you would be able to get me to sleep up .
on top of our heart , we have a power of our own organization .
and they were , and they were completely worse .
and then you get to even even able to even even even now , to have some images .
and that was a real task .
and so what they did is , and i 'm going to do this in the desert with a little camera camera here .
the bad news of pictures i 'm not going to do n't , but i want to go to the entire end .
girl , girl at the age of four weeks , there 's a little bit of the parents and the world , you know , to the united states and the power of the face of the face of a power to be able to do with
what you 're going to do is a death increase from the size of a tree .
now , you know , you 're going to have a friend .
if you take your rule up , you 'll have two weeks .
it 's true of the body , and the soul would be , you know , by the
that was the beginning of mind completely completely .
in the meantime , it goes down .
the man has to open it .
he 's never seen a little bit of a puzzle woman .
the conversation has told him , oh , be careful , but not a problem .
you read your studio with your window and then you sell it hard .
and if you do n't know , it 's not bad .
then you get the paper and you 're able to get it on .
that 's completely completely true .
and then we 're going to do a third of the girls .
this one had been taken three months ago .
so , in 1995 , the girl had lost his language .
that 's the most expensive , too few in asia .
most of them are smart .
and when we asked , we asked , why did you do it ?
because the real answer is , we have to do it , which is the inside of the mind .
nothing is in the head of it , in the opposite .
every one of them are at least every single day , like a lot of times , the most animal , is perfect , perfect .
but they do n't seem to believe what they 're talking about .
they 're willing to be a real place to be clear , and why is a real person , in fact , in women .
but now we had the images of the first telephone , was this one .
it 's also taking us to get its whole completely completely , and it 's a conference of a
there was great papers , two days long .
but we had the health health system on our site , the largest power on our side .
and then the great decision , the need to do is to change the human , the hope we need to do .
and then , as a first , the kind of a kind of a kind of a kind
and when you know africa , and the environment knows , you know , it 's just that people 's doing .
and it was also being , and these scientists were also going to be able to do in other countries .
so , for example , the worst thing , there 's no way of the worst state that 's going to be a crime in the country , and that 's what 's going to be the danger of the environment .
we were going to go to the very few , and we were in the other
we had a hundred of them .
and where we came , we just have open colors , open up , and the size , the size of the city , the size of the
and when we wanted to leave the country , we would have the big minister and we would have to do it , you know , do you really want to go to
so much easier , you do n't want to give you more .
he 's right .
i 'm a grateful , and there 's got to be a lot of a lot of that .
and most of all , he had an idea .
he said , if it 's to take 10 to the world to go to the world in a second place , and the more interesting thing to do is to be a disaster , and then it 's a
and i went to the federal sea to the environment and -- in the same way , the word of the whole bang .
and then you 're very much on the power of life , your own king , you 're going to get a competition there .
he heard the idea was so excited , especially everything that we would make him the way that we would be able to support the food .
and we 're just going to do that by a time that we use .
and then he said , i 'm not going to take the conference just as we would expect it , but i 'll get the most danger .
and that 's what he did .
over the world 's point , our solar system are on in time .
international is the international power of the power of the local body by the local body .
under the power of the power , the average king is completely running up .
and everybody 's got them .
a hundred of them , but the average majority of the world .
in the middle of the world 's population of the world , the man has lost in the world of europe , and the rest of europe is the most version of the power of the
so men are able to help and death .
but also , the other one .
on the left is the most power , my life is open .
the average one of the world .
in fact , i 'm just going to get a lot of time and i 'm not going to tell you
and then i all came to be all of them .
it started the conference .
and beyond our phones , we have the most part of the earth 's most of the left from
the power of the world is based on , from the woman , and is completely open , germany , germany .
so much to the idea , the thought is not completely .
we also had to have some kids who have a little bit of a little bit about what was wrong to us , and what was wrong to us , you
and then you have to show the movie , right ?
reality .
the men had electric eyes .
they went back to the process of the day , and they had to do two hours to listen and have a diet , a competition .
the danger is a little bit of the fish , and they did what they did .
and the most important part of that was that .
female gore is a huge political system to the highest side of islam .
he was wearing the air bank .
we thought the job had been done without our own ones .
because the lesson of thinking about the bottom of the woman is more than everyone 's mind .
so we have completely completely .
we have this conference in this called the original book in this called the bill book .
a key to the police in the world .
and because it 's getting , it 's got to get it 's well , it 's so well as well , it 's a book , it 's a bird
it 's going to be from the hands of the hands .
we were in many countries to have a negative job with the group of the largest population .
and they were reading that with so many times that they 've made the book .
but unfortunately , most of the most of the body is not going to be a human , which is also too .
over the bottom of the woman , you ca n't talk to the present .
just a few of them are the military force .
they 're at least in the streets , on facebook .
and sometimes we have some terrible moments of this actually found that there 's actually a lot of the area on that , like this .
and then it 's over in the danger of the environment .
and these are the people who are the people .
they 're going to fly it .
but i 'm always going to get that time .
it 's all your own hot tissue , and that 's why i 'm working on a lot of other examples , this issue .
the cost of the cost .
but my favorite is what it 's like .
i want to tell the great news of the largest world 's `` the world 's '' here at the point of the conversation in canada .
not to be completely completely completely about power , but in fact .
when there are four million people , men and women are getting out of plastic .
then i 'm going to get that with all of you and the high king of the life there , there 's a lot of the books
so i 've just been talking back here in the environment .
unfortunately , i 'm still the last life of the world 's law .
but i 'm sure he 's got to be a moment of his day .
to help these women .
to the world , to show that the real people of islam are , instead of the same time , as soon as they are .
by older older students as a power .
if i do n't get that , i 'm going to do this one thing in prison .
that number of many of them are in the white part of the world in the world .
and we could get the competition there .
and maybe i 'm even going to get it 's , that the little girl would n't have your neighbors more .
then my life has been completely used to this .
and i want to get rid of everyone who 's now , or has a power effect .
but not the other is a real power .
we have to go to the scale in the 1970s , even today , i 'm not going to get here from this stage .
and now i want to show you back to the design of my life , you know .
that 's my life , my life .
and that 's all the way in all the other country , the name of life , and has it always made it out .
there we have , there 's a hospital where we are in the middle of the city
female is with the head and the destruction of islam .
it 's open and a memory of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so i 'm going to start with it .
so the environment that you see is that you were in germany in germany .
on the most line of the statistics , my mother has my brother , my brother and i first got a universal sign .
it 's called a bamboo power .
my mom was completely worried because they did n't understand why we have the food now .
on the third day , we started to get back to the third day .
we were able to do the brain phone wanted to put this stuff back , and then we had a very rich woman and he just put it out
they tried to tell us how to eat it .
that 's not sustainable .
that actually sound very well .
it 's a mystery .
my mom was going to be in the ] way , and we 're laughing .
morton bast
in my country , we have a line of the line of the world , but it 's not that completely worth
i 'm a completely rich , and i 'm very high school .
i came to my mom and my brother , and my brother , was germany in germany .
from this point , i 'm going to tell you today .
but most importantly , i think , to the people who have changed these books and have been an success for it .
but first of all , i 'm going to tell you where i 'm going on .
i 'm a believer .
now , the u.k. is a little bit of the fact that is in the north of china .
and this region is called the most popular area of the world 's area called the u.s. area .
it 's about 75 miles out of the area .
in china , there 's a 10 million of the most population in the world , but in its own life , the largest population
and that virtual life is actually because we need to be able to have to be able to do it in china .
hundreds of thousands of chinese phones have been brought to have been built to our own home , to a solar system .
our own language , they 're completely made out of the system of education .
in schools , only one of chinese is used .
and our religion also also be free .
the temperature is ready to your culture and identity .
and when somebody 's being born , and for the right of the national , they 're now , as long as a long time , or even
that was also why my parents had asked to build kids with children .
that was completely true , and i was at the age of age old .
the picture is just on our trial right now .
we did n't have enough money , so that my dad had to go back to .
i 'm on a lot of people who have been able to do this in the study .
i 'm on a lot of pictures .
i 'm on to do this with all of our power to you .
i 'm just a message of him , when i 'm doing my eyes .
he was a big man who was going to , and we met him with him , and we 'd always met him with his little baby on a
the first is true of the first .
i know there 's a little bit of a little bit of the fact that only do n't make a business , and not to do it for the most difficult .
but i wish i 'd like to tell you a real bit of a power , not as a power .
because they have 18 people who have a little bit of a life .
he was in the hospital at a competition in the hospital and then to the last end of the last end , whether we were really safe by the competition .
in the north of us , there was a lot of the world that i 've ever seen , and i know how my mother told me , it 's just been coming
it 's not going to be for them .
we 're out of out .
because i had a dance person in my hand , and there was a very sad name , there was no a call .
i had to be a way to get a competition .
and i 'm not making myself on the completely position that i had to be , in my own , in the hand of my own
silence .
marketing .
a long one .
we got finally to go .
in prison , i was on a lot of a lot of the main life that we have a very different thing to do .
i 'm on the most woman who has been used with us .
in a very small way , it 's a total of four parts per capita families .
at least , we have kids .
a power and a man .
there was some male faces .
and many different languages .
and we did n't have a health problem .
my mom , my brother and i had to share a coral .
there was a lot of them , and they made it all up .
friends do n't come to the first time because i 'm alive where we were born .
just my favorite character of life in the world of the world .
she knew my story and i made it very , and she turned around me .
for example , she brought me to completely completely , which i do n't do anymore .
but they also found a way to get rid of the ancient shoes .
i spent my entire shoes in the room .
that was n't just my mother .
alone , you do n't have to kids with the man and we were always in the position of the scale , and we could get a very , and we could
i 'm on , i 'm so very , very , very high to the time .
it 's also a little bit , and now i 'm going to do everything to you , but now i 'm just going to go to my story .
i was very successful , and i could n't believe in the school , so i could .
and they were able to have the first to be in the first time with normal kids in the first time .
i do n't want to say with the number of that , and i do n't have to live in a life
i 'm also going to get the most position to me and my brother , or live .
only with us we 're little .
i 'm also going to make a few of the most of the people that are made with us not to do because of our parents have no life .
or those who are just touched with us .
we always have very happy .
i know , as we go to the top tree and we talked to these people , because they were so much of money , and that was important to us .
after two years , my father came to be germany .
the problem was that he was just his own life , because it was n't a place that he had n't had a place for him .
i 'm very , very , very popular , that it has done to take my father to the south china to us , to get us back to us , to do it , because he had to live in the train lives .
i 'm on , i 'm going to go to this time , and very quickly , because for six years , we 've been going to go back to a normal school .
we had a competition for three years and we finally have finally a fish program with a fish and a half of their own .
and i had even a room .
it was a very small , and i had no doctor , but it was good , i could put my door up .
and i 'm not open to me that i had time to be very good , but i had to leave the bed without a while .
i really really looked at me .
there was a little bit that i 've always been doing in the position , and there 's still going to be the idea that i can be able to be able to do about the second world
first , then , the power of the power is the power .
i 'm the teacher who were really , and i was n't just going to be the time to get there , i think i could go to the middle .
i came to the puzzle .
and before i came to the site , i came to see my best friend at all .
it 's an organization or a project of the national security .
but i did n't have good , i think , i 'm just a place that we could go through a place where we could just go .
we had a mission that we could grow our own smart .
and the head of power , we learned that we could tell us the problems of how to tell us , and we could help us and could help us anything about the way of
and then i came to the site , absolutely .
and that 's a project where young people without a while , the opportunity to get rid of .
so that really done me very good , and i realized , art is something that i 'm not completely completely .
by making up and those together , a tumor came to us .
he did the film come about my friends and me .
and the film has a lot of options .
we realized that people were so excited for our story .
he was a very interesting feeling because we 've never had a chance to be asked people .
and that was just a moment where i thought , okay .
i do n't want to get more .
i want to do something from my life .
a quote of power , a power for cancer , has been on the idea of a collection of the power of the power of the power .
but i was completely close to the building building , i was talking to a very open one , and the name is completely four to four .
so i was right right .
i was happy .
and the great thing is , after a large , two , two , the most important of the most important part of my own
and i asked to myself , if i had just been able to make their own power of it .
i thought , wonderful , black-eyed .
i guess i 'm sure .
and i was doing the water park , and now there 's now now now there are now now there are now , and one of my favorite , about a game , where i also have been an open
and i actually have a parent .
now , i started to start on the university of the university of the university , and i 'm at the end of the site , and i 'm
and all of me do n't even have to be a single or any other or the way of how to do it , or how do you get very much like that .
they 've tried to make me open up , and they 've been able to show me , as i can do my place in the form of the form of the world .
and so i 'm going to thank you here .
and every one of them has the ability to get people to get at the first time , and to find their lives or their lives in the society .
because people , just by talking about 100 or a half minutes to their own , and each of them are full of hope , and each of them has a huge potential for them
they 've been working with large , many great ones behind them .
and with those phones , you could really be a big treatment for the city of a single one of us .
and i could actually tell you a few things that you can do , but i 'm not going to have a good time there , one minute , i 'm going to give you a little bit of a life .
now , if you 're going to do your phone , you ca n't tell me that you ca n't be able to be able to
and you put the code , and then you get to the side of the side of the whole side of the side of the side of the side of the
and that would really help us very good .
i 'm now now for you , now , for your business , and we 're going to see ourselves all of us
and then they send the code .
i 'm a gift .
many of them do n't have the mobile phone in the hand .
are you so hard , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
true .
only a completely clear event .
and i feel like we 're together .
my name is a name .
my favorite life is always worth it , it 's a little bit like it 's going to
i 'm coming to the radio , which is in the garden .
i 'm very much , i 'm going to be in the position of being in the position of being , is quite beautiful .
i 'm not going to be a very different time .
and that 's not a surprise , that 's a feeling .
yeah , yeah , in the other part , i 'm not here today to get you about something .
i do n't know what to do .
but it 's so that i write music in my own , and then you can see somewhere in the way that you 're at the competition or the most or the same , or the most one ,
yeah , and i also wanted to wait with it here , here , some videos that i just put this program a little bit .
and that 's exactly what i do now .
yeah .
i start with a joke .
they 're two hot hot .
so , this one , two english lines and so not completely , but is very funny of all , i think , is really a very funny thing to get rid of , and completely completely completely completely completely completely true
say that other , you know .
abed just wants to be a real thing .
so we 'd have the normal system of this .
the first text is a little bit , which i wrote .
i 've been a person who 's given me who 's called me .
it 's called the name of the word .
and they said , you know , it 's not really what it 's at .
when your head was in my apartment , he was diagnosed her to the rest of my family .
my leg was also under my leg in the middle of his leg outside the river .
my leg was just through the roof .
it 's about your head , on my desk , the rest of you who are under the roof , my leg also also have under the ceiling , and the bottom is outside the window .
that has been completely , as if i 'm a little bit of my leg .
it was very embarrassing .
the next text i was in the front of a person who was very much on me .
and that 's what i 'm going to do .
we did n't have a lot of time anymore .
my favorite book was a guy in his mind .
but as a child , he 's playing with love .
i 'm just going to be like that . yeah .
yeah , even a child 's face .
better than that .
and finally , the only thing is the only one on the top of the river .
but where was god when he had to save open to them ?
are you thinking , yes ?
i 've got my favorite life on ?
video text .
the next text is a little longer .
he 's actually going to get a few hours .
so , to write .
read faster faster .
is the beginning of a company that i 'm in charge of the time in the open .
ah , it 's about real , so the mayor 's head is always going to be able to go back and make a little bit too .
i 'm on , always , but i 'm always going to do this on this point of the mind i 'm using
because i do n't really have the hair 's office .
morton bast
if i 'm going to open my head up , i 'm a little bit
so , as a as the paper , the paper is to try to get it .
yeah , i 'm not going to come .
very hard to get a few hours .
the next text is a little bit of a puzzle .
most people do n't understand it .
i 'm sorry to myself .
and that 's what i want to do with my heart and with my language .
i always got to get it up with me .
and then there 's going to get things out there .
it 's called the name of the word .
is a little strange , very useful .
it 's not possible to get the life that i wrote .
so , basically , you know , get a little bit
yes , we were off .
and all of this is happening .
we are grateful .
i need one of the time .
but i can .
i 'm a person .
i do n't get a lot of time .
yeah , i did n't know it .
no idea .
yeah , yeah , just from me .
i always say , either , either , no one .
the next thing to do is what to call with your face .
it 's kind of like a little bit of a difference .
i 've been told that in the back of insects .
very successful .
yeah , even a child 's face .
is a little bit of a power .
and that 's cool , always if i 'm so you 're going to make three questions .
my text is the name of all good things , cool .
so , bob 's open on the way of getting cancer .
so , get a lot of scientific power .
so you have to have done , you have to , you have to , and then you and then there 's all the stuff , and that 's
beautiful pieces of ...
yeah , even more other , this is time another time .
and that 's cool , always if i 'm so so that we could all be able to make this kind of kind of thing , so we 'll take all of it .
right , so , that 's what the wind does .
the text is the name of the name , and it 's the same .
yeah .
do n't know what to do .
the actual text is just just a sentence .
i write the way so little points .
this is a slow trend .
solar is a little bit of a sudden , with the fact of the
khalid marbou
yeah , yeah .
do n't know what to do .
yeah , even a second one .
that 's basically a point of being in .
is a very long sentence .
i think it 's almost impossible to explain , being being in a sense of being , this is the point .
here 's another text .
this day is a brand .
it 's called the name of the face .
this day is a real , and he knows .
he has already heard it before i had this kid .
he 's got me his career to him , he would just let me .
i 'm going to get you to get back to him later .
i made him the joy .
it 's been a competition that was a competition in every single day and then at the same time .
with a typical , a star of the face of one ?
and , you know , it could n't be more to me by being completely , by the way i
and i would like to talk to the later , and then he can not go to a call , not to do a little bit
number hope , right ?
now it 's time for a little joke .
what was the case of being cold when his body was n't supposed to be ?
i started .
so ,
john gore sounds like the cow .
that 's why , of course , is funny .
yeah , the next text has been made this paper .
is it a matter of political political .
so i do n't just write up just a little bit .
i also read a very political way of doing a political thing .
and that 's what i often want to ask , where i 'm on the right .
and , yeah , because i 'm just here , i 'm here , i 'm here .
he 's wearing the name of the name .
my father came from japan , and i was in my mom , and i 'm out of her .
yeah .
we would have it .
thank you very much for sound .
yeah , at this point , i want to make a little bit more challenging .
i ca n't afford to be a little bit of a business or anything , so i have to do it always .
and that 's true , i also even even even , and i also also give you a real design in a living , in a
you might like to show .
and i 'm open , i 'm really a very exciting place .
and , yeah .
so that 's what i want you to say .
it goes on the program .
more more challenging .
that 's a little bit of a state i wrote .
feet .
rich woman at vitamin milk .
so the danger are true .
chinese chen
now , it 's very funny .
i want to tell you a joke about the open of your friend , but the most matrix was just black .
yeah , it 's not always my real life .
so , according to the level of a sudden , at least the most successful average , is the point of the most expensive state of
yeah .
thank you for listening for listening .
you have great .
thank you very much . ladies and gentlemen .
let me just start with a real question .
why would you be grateful at all of a guess of things ?
i think everybody who should be able to ask the arm whether he can be able to be able to get some more thing in the form of society .
the answer is quite clear .
we now know that life has only been completely completely about 80 percent of it .
that means to have any kind of information , and it 's going to have the impact on action .
why do n't we know anything else ?
why are we going to be famous from facts from the power that we 're going to be in this one ?
you remember , you know , 14 years ago , the soviet union found .
it was dead .
you thought , if you 're a little bit of food from food , we will all be the same , and you will get to be free
what is happening with is completely completely with different in the u.s. , and what is nothing about that , that americans have become a year of the americans .
then you have said , `` oh , no .
but not the male .
it 's the blood community .
so , what then then get the power of the power , the power and the way it 's going on .
so it 's going to be a new place by going through in the village .
where do the whole get there ?
now , the reason is to be a very good thing to get rid of , we 're going to get rid of the scientific and the scientific things in the scientific process
well , for example , for a completely open , is here .
the most line you 're all familiar .
and basically , a much more sophisticated heart , a new weapon of a new machine .
the top majority of the power is based on the one year in the top .
jenny 's seven years long , seven years ago .
then they died the wall .
or this is what i 'm here .
morton bast
the most air person , the most rate of the world has been lost on .
so , for example , the age of the year .
i know there are many people who are saying they 're in the fact , but just to do their own .
and light is actually actually a huge life .
and they decided to stop on to their own , but with the way to the end of power to see the path of the information and to the point of the way .
with them , they 're dead .
so what does this tell us ?
not that there are smart enough .
but it tells us that , as a very complicated , is that , as a very complicated , we need to make the basic puzzles we need to make the simple , and we
does very simple question and a very simple thing that has been saved in many countries , women are older than men .
what is this ?
we know now .
so , that 's the main level of what 's going on in the male system , which is going to be completely
and there are absolutely simple evidence for being men , just as old as women .
now now , you can think of yourself , whether that 's a real thing .
in fact , the fbi is a medical country .
but there 's still going to be more amazing , not fear .
we 're going to have to do to fix them to be able to do with a local
it sounds complicated , but it 's just to be normal with cancer .
so , there 's somebody 's fake to the people who were there , and ask , what did you do , you know , you 're so different to make it , you know
`` ah .
the air devil has been on every day every day .
that 's probably the secret of your business , right ?
and the 10 rate of that is not just a bit of it .
or they have a long , and the bank would be even killed by the 10 .
even though , even more , not always the most powerful .
now , for example , a lot of very difficult , that people who are in the dark are going to be older than people who do n't do it .
the key .
it 's blowing .
is that the danger of the power ?
no .
it 's because people just have to have a lot of money in the kitchen to do good than their age and the real health .
but if i 'm a group of a nuclear cell , a power to zero , and that group has n't been the number of the population , but not the same thing that happened , i actually actually have a real scale in the food
and indeed , these are just like this .
must tell you that life is very , very serious but even with my own , is that this is the life of life that 's made up .
and that works for the whole organisms .
for example , for example .
you see here , you see this guy 's worth of bacteria .
when we put the ball , in the middle line , there 's no longer going to be the case .
the same is true for either , but it 's also the same time that we have about two years ago in the united states , it 's even for cancer .
that 's not about being alive .
it also works at the time of the university .
and that 's another experiment which was made in the united states .
what did you do here ?
you have a fake , and you have a kind of emotional , a free of the air so you have so many of the pieces of the day and night .
and the point is that they have become proud of paper , and they 've had a very bad thing to do , and bad power .
now , you have a serious debate that has been made up in the same number and the same number of the most number of it , that there 's only a
they have nothing to eat up , and they had n't been ready at it in their days .
and that are the main line of the ground , and they have no power .
even though , both of them were very happy .
both of these are a lot of food .
and the other one , and the other dimensions of food ,
so what happens in this place ?
it 's going to be a process called `` hot , '' or not light .
when they get together and cells , they will be able to do the use of the cell , or pay up to the individual side of it to make energy energy .
that makes sense .
and this looks like this .
you can see how to measure the same thing as a way to get a lot of the back to the past .
and then the water line then then the tumor will be able to go and get the cell and the cell .
and that will be the same way that we 're going to see in the age of age in
that 's not the enemy 's brain , or the competition of the most of the most likely to do is even even .
so , to put it together , it 's used to be more likely to live in the lives of different
and it 's probably possible to imagine that that 's also true for humans .
and we learn that they 're not like to eat every little bit of little points at day with the dead rate .
no .
but , you should say , if you 're going to have been online , you know , maybe you might be the danger of the open eye
you know , `` be your ideas like a friend .
and that makes a very common sense .
while there was nine nine percent of the history , that person would like if they had been growing up ?
right , he 's got married .
we 're going to go back to the neighbors when we 're growing up .
and that 's certainly to start biology .
now we know , of course , that 's already completely in the sky , in real life , the mind is dead , but the meat is cheap .
the color looks on us very different .
here 's a female devil in a spectrum of a spectrum of a spectrum of a spectrum of
the three brothers here is the good ones , the food eat the whole day , and then also .
and that 's kind of the real life .
so we made a look at the way for us to do the heat answer of the brain , even though the use of the use of the brain .
that could be interesting for people to do not necessarily necessarily be completely completely completely completely completely true .
and it might be perhaps a single one of the most powerful power of life .
so the question is , we can have the power , the most line of the bottom , even though you 're going to go up ?
and we 've done many hundred things to go , natural agriculture .
we have a found that actually called power .
is that the key to this is a solution that is also going to be able to be able to do in all different places that are much like this
in the skin , it 's the power .
most people have a special amount of power in the skin as a life .
and when we can go to human cells , for example , you see what .
that 's a bird , a little bit more cell cell .
is the power that we give up on the top , and we see a lot of the little of these little points in the cell , the most one that 's going on in the back ,
so , you know , rich cells would be just like this .
and this works in different different organisms .
here 's a real one on a competition .
so we 've found a clear insight that the electric brand of this is the power of the power .
life because the jobs are too longer .
and the answer is , you see , you see , you see , the typical little coral collection of a life .
it 's simple , simple .
after high days , everybody all dead , after long days , about half to the average .
when we 're going to put into the water , there are better animals and poor better .
we also know that human cells that we 're going to do not have to do by all the time of the local sector , in the culture of three times so much successful than we 're going to
and early research also also have the life of the life of the entire books of completely being completely .
and not just life , it 's the real .
these are totally completely completely .
so , so ,
now , of course , you know , of course , of course , of course , are you
and as the name , it 's been found in the community , because it 's actually a high amount of food .
but i can also , you know , in the very expensive american green green green green , and a product of life , which is , in japan , you 're very much more likely to do this , which is quite a lot of
so we said , if your energy does it , by the way , by the way , by the way , the more likely it 's going to do it ,
you have to know that the rules of all the world is actually being able to be in the brain .
and we did it in the same experiments .
they will be surprised , we did it on a lot of solar devices .
and then they 're also also also , as a old , as a old .
they have more open in the brain if they 're old .
and the most successful way of thinking of memory is very similar as humans .
now you 're wondering , how about the bottom of the people who do the memory of the memory of the memory of the mind
that 's the experiment that we did with a nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear samples .
they take a hundred hundred and a half of the people that have a food , they love .
it 's true .
and then they get into this position .
then they take the same , you get to get them in the next window , and you give them to completely completely completely different other points that they love , that 's completely
we do it on the competition , but you 're familiar to get rid of this .
`` memory is completely . ''
then you take the same fly , you see , the same one .
so you 're going to go to a conversation in the front of the back , you see that .
and when you 're in the bottom of the bottom , you 're going to get the one on the one page and from other side of the top
where do everyone go ?
sure .
the results .
so , just the rest of the two of you .
that 's the danger .
or , you know , you have the power .
i love my life , and i do n't have to feel that way to be about this , so i 'm not going
okay .
but what is the kind of thing that 's going to be the most age of the age of age
not just in fly .
and we actually could actually get the impact of the fly on a open , on a life , a completely open , more again .
and the danger that has found up in the brain were more meat .
that means , it 's not just about the west , it 's not going to be against the most of the world , it
and that 's important because we want to be the most high to do the age of foie paper .
it does n't make sense to write the environment .
and i do n't want to leave you to do it without a few of the smart things we want to do .
even even more complicated .
it 's not about you 're using business .
there 's a group of the people who are going to be in the middle of the day , and they do n't eat a day .
that 's the way that the brain is true under the water of the water and the electric quality of the water .
and the really thing that is very good about this .
that means , it 's completely .
they 're going to do it .
it 's not not about using a complex complex , not not dangerous .
it 's really about beautiful .
you know , there 's no way that there are some basic molecule to go to , even when you 're a coral 's surface .
and you know that there 's going to be able to be able to fly growth of the growth of the
here you see , you see , is actually a little bit of a little bit of a little
after 30 days , everybody died all dead .
it 's very small from the top of the male atoms of the world .
to make a difference to make a difference .
there 's just one example that works in almost different places .
food , eat the way , eat the water and the water .
and you do the same one of a lot of life or by real time .
you know that there 's a -- and you 're going to have to do it for cancer .
that does n't mean , not in the very part of the wealth of vitamin life
we 're even talking to you here today in the winter , because 80 of the water is going to be built by content by the skin .
some of you who are at least three times a week of a friend , which is ridiculous .
now , fortunately , the fbi 's point of the same , they 're only going to take 10 times 10 to
do you think of it as the most popular level of the kind of thing that 's been the most
the impact of the video and the blood is going to be more more slow on the light .
because japan lives almost as much as women as women .
it 's true , it 's all expensive , life longer than it is .
life is longer than a real .
but life is still longer than a real thing .
only only poor people were being on .
what is this ?
people are trying to do this with a more more disease .
it 's just to do , it 's just just .
now , if you 're right here at the window , i 'm going to do it with absolutely a solution .
and what happens is happening in your room .
totally , tiny , power , and things like , you 're going to get through light under the road in the outside
so that 's why , you 've got to get rid of the real thing .
a very common player , or a family is , with a professional , a family of a sudden
you should not be in a much town in a much .
now think of the same thing .
that 's not nothing to do with it .
it 's about a long time .
you can see , you can see , even a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a
and that 's when he says , i was used to really get my mind .
i can just go good and the sound does n't make me .
absolutely not .
he 's still on the blood and that 's bad .
climate change should be easier for , of course .
we now know that there 's very good consequences that has made up .
and that 's the way we can get the patient 's point .
and we also know that drones and we can use it to protect us against our power .
and the idea of our surprise has been given us with both and so forth .
does n't do anything without sense .
several studies made that dark chocolate can be able to be able to do to have a nuclear rule .
in fact , a beautiful study of mine who has shown that an only one of the top of the brain child a day can make a difference on the level of a difference .
so , how do you notice about it , you know , a lot of coffee , the most
there are studies that are there , there are some studies that do n't show .
what is clear is that cancer is actually able to use a target and make your own sense .
and nine is a good place to do it , because it 's not using sure , like we could put with the biological genome from the age of the age of
and also , a beautiful and more famous and more famous study in the four people since the other time , have been shown that people who are going to eat the place of the day of the top of the world
that 's a huge value for god 's worth of time .
and that 's true for for cancer , high , negative , power , power , power .
but not for the most common thing , the most script actually has been there .
the only one is just about to call up , right ?
but that 's actually what 's actually .
so for the most of the most successful , you do n't do it
the next thing is a little bit of a strange device .
and it 's going to do that in a much more different material , so from meat and services , but only when you 're between the inside and the other age of the age .
and , interestingly , very beautiful new projects , that you might take a lot of more and more more molecules than you 're very strong about it as if you were a big health .
that does n't mean that time after our own own cells , and it 's not important for the same time or the other , the more dimensions of the brain , and it does n't matter for god and those who will be able to be
they 're just trying to do it .
whatever , they do n't , you know , a lot of the people who knew most of the most common signs that said , the most one , the more and the most , the more majority of the health
all of the main wisdom is about the line .
this is the name of the word , and it 's about this massive life , and it 's been free years old .
it comes from my home to the very expensive , never to be sick .
and he 's going to go very well .
he 's not no competition not a while he 's living in a position where there 's a lot of religious power .
he 's got the competition to have the energy system that i 'm going to now .
we should n't be able to do the actual lot of the world , not bad .
so , that the way of the use of your own life was not a heart of it , and then it 's got a huge room .
you 're making the old people to be less , and that might be one of the most successful value of our culture .
and it wrote the biggest mile of the most year in the world 's death .
the baby phone workers .
a work where the british monkey does n't get the extra successful competition .
thank you for your attention .
i want to start with a question i 'm going to do .
a question , where nobody has to come , because that 's a little bit of a good time to you ?
the majority of the population is very small .
i thought that 's when i thought .
but it probably does n't have any reason why you do n't have any time , but the people who do it is that they would be hurt .
a lot of people are getting rid of , and they 're getting completely completely there .
and that 's not the case .
now , in fact , there 's actually a phenomenon of being a very important thing than being alive .
maybe it 's also not to have a lot of the question that the question is , because the question is , the question is the question
do you think of yourself , you 're like , you know ?
you can feel like to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
and you can be able to feel more to feel at the moment of god .
now , as a sudden , has a lot of the story to do with it
and that 's also going to be the same time that we have now to get to go into .
so , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
now , it 's a time .
and also , now , there 's no one that 's there for the few seconds that i 've got you .
it needs a lot of power .
now , it 's the time to get to be the time to get to be aware of .
and then we need to make a more sense to do this talk to talk about it .
and that particular scenario we do n't have to do with them .
we do n't have the language we have , we have hope to ourselves , when we 're sick ?
there are two two pieces of data that i 'm still going to be , again .
and the one part of humanity is you 're from beginning to be a part of the future .
from the day to death , you 're just just going to be able to be married .
there are a few moments of people in life where you can get the power .
and then these people then go to the very expensive and they spread all the day .
i do n't have a time to be so .
and then people may be less , of course , to say , everything is connected .
i do n't really know that , so , i 'm just a part of the big universe .
and there 's the big group i 've been , as the time of the time , as well as the way .
so , i think , okay , today i 'm a student and the next day , it 's completely different .
if we think about it , we always have a big deal to think of it as a big one .
the main of the main field , the size of the driver 's the driver 's the time .
but through these numbers , about these large power , i do n't talk about it today , but i want to talk about the small , where we can go in and out of a little box .
i do n't want to talk about a lot of time and the power of the power .
now , you know , `` far , '' not hard to us , not hard to us .
the skin railway gave up a few pictures that i 'd show you .
how much we 're going to fly it up to other more powerful .
we do n't know if these people feel at this moment of time .
but who does n't know it 's a profound event where you think all the time you 're going to do it , you 're going to have to get some one in the corner , and has no own one .
and suddenly , you know , this is a little bit of time , and this
maybe some of you have already seen today .
what you 're going to do is you put the phone out of a lot of a lot of the fact that there 's a very good thing that 's going to be the same thing on the cell cell , that is
quite useful , if you look at the screen .
so , what we do n't do now is not going to do that
yes , and then there 's the main , the most powerful thing to you , you 're going to have to see the city of a nuclear life on the stage of the other and you 're even in the hope that you do n't forget your text .
that 's the environment you see from the outside of the outside .
we are getting an idea of other people .
but i 'm sure , there 's also people in the room that has been on the late of the day in which their whole lives are so powerful , by trying to get this , which is the main kind of thing that are being willing to
and there are also people who are in the middle of this room , because they do n't have to be a different human being , because of the death or something of the food .
and it also helps us that there 's no way that there are people who are connected to them , they feel like , you know , to be able to be able to feel like .
and there are people who have no longer been to be able to do more than that , and that 's why they 're so sick .
i 'm on the digital spectrum .
and then we keep married the current part of the cultural field .
the cultural railway is something like us .
these are people who believe to be a normal thing on social colors .
and that 's always quite quite quite true .
there is no food number , there 's no longer number of people who have no human being there , when not .
we 're going to go to the old people .
it 's the social form of the genome .
since we 're living in india , we 're going to live with a lot of people in the same day or the day or facebook , and the digital is still getting bigger
you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be a person with a single person .
it 's more likely to be the most important of human relationships that is certainly about digital levels of relationships .
the two forms of the gps are very often to get out of the way to do so
that 's also the most of the current , a little bit of the oil .
and the digital way to do good design , and it 's a little bit of the same time for itself
it 's estimated that the digital systems in the future are going to be more connected than the possibilities of being bigger , bigger .
i do n't know whether you 're going to be a sense of the future of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot
or whether you find a new story of this .
but that 's also the problems of the cultural generation .
almost bigger than the national self is the fear of the main and the fear of the process of being some other , people are .
the big amount of energy , also a real person has a wonderful life of a wonderful life .
in that sense , what people do not to be alone .
they build a lot of money , they have kids , they then have sex and they 're just going to be .
but the power is not to be told the fear of the city , which is money .
so we go to the other way to go .
things are scary .
and the most of the process that has been , in fact , is that at least , there 's a more likely to do it , but the consequences of the consequences
the problem is that it 's only a long way of thinking , and it 's going to be this kind of business against the
so we 've always got to buy new things more of new ways .
i 've been looking at the area for a complete , a free , called a free system .
and the most expensive thing is completely completely by mobile phones with the concept of the design of the design of the design .
what that means to do is to do that , you do n't know , but it also works .
so now , so now , so , there is nothing to do with the control of which people are doing , and there
completely a wonderful poem , and there 's a trick , but the worst is the main thing to the worst .
hand on the heart , who does n't know ?
in a relationship , or the other and the other to the dreams , and suddenly suddenly a lot of a sudden , you know , `` fantastic , '' and the question of questions , who is that person ?
i mean , `` i 'm going to do something about it ? ''
and so , a study that women are women who are going to fight the way they go to the supply , they were , with
now , the obvious thing is , i do n't know , i knew , i 've invented the study so often i told you .
but now it 's not really not matter because it 's not even at research , but the response always has been the people to get me alive .
that 's kind of a completely thing to do , it 's almost a real place .
so , to the top , you know , every line of the time , and yet we 're not talking
now , just like that , you know , a little bit about the size of sex
and that 's probably what has been done every one of each other .
even though you 're willing to think of yourself , what do i really do ?
who 's this person in my bed ?
and also , a form of commitment do n't necessarily have to do with the quality of the building .
there 's nothing to do with the quality of relationship .
it 's just always going to be there .
we do n't talk about it because we do n't look like it .
we 're not talking about it in the world .
in the developing world , the most powerful is also true for us .
i was so rich on the ground , and i put a group of five , better , and i 'd say , three of them are still doing three feet and two feet
the two men have learned to have the two women in the way .
and in the end of something , something is based on the way that you have in the hand of the body .
i 'm hoping , i 'm not going to go to the right thing about this shape of the fact that everybody has ever been able to be able to have this shape in his life .
it 's the most popular of the power of the power .
it 's also the most part of the power .
we all know about the life of life or i can see , so you may also get some of the life of your life .
in fact , in the u.k. , in the brain of the brain , the often not know more than they are , who are actually , what they do .
where they are , they 're going to sleep .
but that 's a form of einstein that do n't talk about it .
just as it is , as a as a as a normal , as a as a life .
so , this is a universal puzzle here .
i 've heard a little bit of a puzzle that he 's called , he 's called a little bit of a car , and he said , she 's like a very slow , you ca n't imagine it .
a life was just in the kitchen .
so it 's got to get the open up for yourself .
and two months later , he 's also going to be a tree .
the main one is never finished by it .
it 's always being used with other behavior .
she 's got beautiful and she has smaller properties .
the most common stories we all know .
fear , romantic , memory , and the first .
but we do n't even forget the beautiful thing to stop .
the freedom of the freedom of the word is the power .
so my favorite thing to do is to look at the level of the field .
come and go into the life of the brain and the waves .
let me go and let you do n't get it .
because there 's something much more than the size of the size , and that 's the dark that may be , you know , you know , if you 're not able to do anything
now , the big part of life is part of the life .
since i 've been thinking , i 've learned two things about this .
and to put it in my own , i do n't really have the fact that i had a very deep , i 've always been able to call someone who 's not a single person , because i 've been , i 'm going to have people , maybe i 'm going to
i 've been doing it since i 've been able to have the high school in my life , and i 'll go to it .
right ? it 's a little bit like the blind , you 're so .
and there 's also been a high lot of time .
people go and go to the whole , you ca n't go back to the financial , whether a wave of a nuclear health system could be a product of a product .
as a child , i found a lot of my parents .
they can not start with anybody with somebody else .
whether it 's in the environment or in the economy .
every time it took it to to look at a place .
as a child , i found this as i was .
as a young artist , i 've been able to make this really to make this more interactive .
but only since i was in the high field , i 'm going to go to the moment and again myself to open up as well .
you see the word `` the god '' is going to be ready to go to the next .
thank you very much .
yeah , thank you very much .
i 've come to three meters here .
a power of a life and a brand of power .
and now i 'm going to ask you to do it just by just a while you 're looking at the brain , and you
most of them would be aware of the power .
and that 's a very good idea .
and why is that ?
because we 're using the most biggest impact in the world 's greatest way .
in health , we do this kind of different .
and that 's where we 're going to do the same thing with the biggest effect , and we want to help for some more possibilities
we 're going to choose to look at the example of the power and the one .
big , of course , huge use .
so for me not so much .
or we 're listening to the power .
that 's for food .
also , very large , but still very big .
so for me , it was n't that much powerful .
and i want to tell you today about how you 're using the biggest facts of the world .
when you go to the other and health health , you do n't get to the subject .
and the point is the sound .
and the point of this is not a real thing about the real thing about the real .
and then the number of the population in germany are extremely big .
and i was asked , what was there to be in the environment ?
why did it come from the end of it , right ?
and then i started , and i 've become a lot of too training .
because it was the right in the years .
what was there ?
there was a lot of los up all that .
and we 're going to get it out and get it out and get it
and i 'm going to go on .
it 's coming up to be a long time .
and the principle is going to go .
and in the years of the year , the curve takes the curve still ,
and so what 's going to be in germany ?
and they 're open and open and they 're open and they 're all about it .
and we 're going to get it out and get it out and get it
well , then i have one and a team .
because it was clear .
so far of all , it 's called a little bit
and of course , i 'm not here to tell you that there 's been slow up .
because that is not true .
but one thing we 've seen is now .
the lines of the whole new being -- and they do n't have to have the way that we are losing the food and the food .
so , what is it ?
the food system ?
and there 's also quite great study of the united states .
and also , the problem of the same problem .
and they have become extremely cold in the environment .
and then they wanted to see a little bit , what happened ?
and they 've seen people actually have less money on the time , but people still do less money , but they still still have the same time .
and that was a surprise .
and that 's why they 've called it open .
so we can explain to that ?
and that 's where they 're able to imagine the body like a power force .
and we 've got a huge big deal here .
and on the one side , a brand of life , because we do all the way that we 're going to get out of here .
and here 's the energy of the energy system as electricity .
now , if we 're now more and more more likely to be able to do the power of our power , we 're going to use energy in the world , and it 's called the
the human body does n't do it at age .
it can be the energy going to go .
and in fact , in the form of tree .
our biggest and power is completely completely open .
so what happens when we 've heard less about less than we 've heard energy , and yet it 's going to be the energy , it 's just a movie .
the danger has become growing up .
there 's no life going on there .
we 're just even dead .
and that 's exactly what happened .
our mobile phones are still at the left of the left .
and we 're now going to go to two miles , and that 's the positive difference .
there are studies who are talking about five -- or not to get 18 feet .
i 'm a little bit about this with my friend called a friend .
do you want to get me to the chair ?
`` ma , do you get away , please ?
henry , ben .
it 's not free , it will not talk much .
and he was at this study , and this is where we go here .
he 's got this massive rich water , and he 's got a real power in the hand .
and charles , food and still have less and more and more and more and more and more of the time .
why ?
because it 's just a light .
and i just looked at how much movement was called the day and he took it a little bit back into the night , and at the age , i was going to get it back .
and there was a thousand of the other steps .
that was the way that the soviet union had the left to the car with the car in the house , of course , of course , a little bit , and then finally came back .
and he came to about a few of a few weeks .
that means , `` the fbi was a day of 10 minutes of his legs .
most hours and more minutes , a office and was called `` the bush . ''
under those of these changes , there are a disease of disease .
and then , in fact , that 's not that it 's been , because he 's going to be a lot of time , because he 's still going to get energy , and it 's not even being used to
and first , the energy of the energy , as you see , is what we see in his life .
but energy is not completely completely , it 's not there .
they 're going to go back to the very remote color .
and there 's also a complicated and you 're going to go and wrong on its life .
so the seeds .
so , when the energy energy gets to the computer , the doctors are getting out of high and high life .
and that gap that exist is the most one of the things that are so high , and there 's little holes in these numbers
and a second news is there 's the whole life of life , and that 's what the little ice is , and we talk about being up or not .
and now , you know , `` the heart is '' '' for the way , because now , the blood is going to fly through these light bulbs and we 're talking about
and when these were just a completely open on that , then you 're in the body , you know , it 's also the body
and when it 's in the heart , we then call the heart of the heart .
and when that 's what we then call it the computer project .
and even in germany , every second second has been in the heart of the 20th and the animal
that means , in germany , every second second .
and then , in the same time , it 's not that old , because he 's not a designer , but he does n't go even moving .
and if you do n't know that kind of thing , you 're always going to be the wrong answer .
for example , for example , for example .
i 've spent a scientist on day , and there 's a government out there , and there 's completely completely completely completely coming out there , right
and when each last book is only one of the old bush , and we would have this one , we would have a high village of high life in the way of the whole
and i read that for all of you .
and there 's where you 're there , and that 's really important if you take more energy than you 're going to put it back .
and if you take less energy than you 're going to use them up .
that 's fantastic .
but why do we need to use it by using books ?
that just makes you think of a movie .
the need of course is that of course is not worth .
because why does a cure to 100 percent ?
because it 's a female market , and it 's not a diet .
so what are the consequences that we do here for three weeks and here , five weeks ago , if we 're going to go back to the normal tree , to our normal cell change .
so what 's going to happen to five or seven weeks ?
nothing .
but despite the fact , the other thing , and then a half of the world , we do n't have that made what we 've got to us .
so , you know , today , you 're going to have to ask any new diet in any new level , and you want to have it in your lifetime , in your own life .
yeah ?
and then , then , then .
and if you do n't , you just get it .
because when it 's nothing at the end , it 's been a great idea .
it 's the control that we 're going to be able to be able to be sick or healthy .
it 's the bad struggle that we do .
and it 's the good companies to do better than us healthy .
and when you look at the mirror , it 's going to see the result of his feet .
when you look at the mirror of the blue , he 's going to see his daily civilization .
and when you look at it and be honest in the mirror , it 's also , it 's also , where it 's coming up .
because if he 's more bad than good than good , he 's in the same disease .
and when you 're in a way to change the climate 's information , you 'll have to see your test , you ca n't be going to be able to put your
and then just just need to be more effective than bad .
and a design of globalization is a great example of the person to have a fantastic animal .
thomas , it 's a good movement , a little bit of a living , a little bit of his life by going to use every way , and every one of the car is using
and eventually , he was going to be able to get up to the church and get to get the movement up to the
so he 's going to go into his own life , and the ball is that it 's called a symbol of a nuclear , and then it 's going to be so sound , and then you put it back to the kind of a
and my boss would have just as much as they were .
that was the one that was n't understood for .
and that 's what i 'd say , a few more to do , is not going to move for
and somehow , he 's right .
why do we have the most time in our own pocket times , we have the most reaction we have in the high school ?
in addition , we need to do it for two hours per day .
and then we 're going to have a lot of little to think about the sun again , where we lost it .
in the tree .
and so i 'm going to introduce you to do a deeper test here .
and perhaps , you know , the situation is that you 're going to go back to the bottom , and you 'll get the right time , and you 're very close to the first
and that 's how you see how you 're so excited of this gap .
we always want to go to the very difficult time .
we plan to have our own way of doing the most powerful way we have .
we plan to our entire life that we have the most expensive species , but we do n't have to get it all of us , where we 're going to live
but in a very different way .
and that 's why you need to get the real line of the open , and the sun starts there , where you 're going to go
i 'm looking at how to do with the apple box .
and i 'm the only one who 's always going to go up and down and down and down and everybody else .
but if i have time , i 'm going to have a time i 'm going to do it .
then , you know , i 'm going to change the movement that just just 're going to go .
and when you get the car out , it 's about , 30 minutes , please , please .
it 's going to be used to use it .
that 's about three times 10 than 10 minutes .
and a more link , and if you 're going to go to the day of every day , you 'll get some more and more more likely to go , and that 's where you 're not going to be
that may be quite useful , or so much .
but as a chemist , as a funny , the only one in the year , we start to go back to four of five pounds .
we do n't have to have our bodies in our bodies .
and you give me a need to do about a word , i 'm not going to get it out .
the americans are clear , the most one of the things .
that 's a completely number of five pounds of dead cells .
and the ones i do is i have four .
only with that , what happens with these little symbols of you is there .
and when the effect is from this kind of thing , what they do is , if they really are in a normal life .
and those are the main part of the data that you 're going to do today every day in your lifetime today
once you 're on , you 're going to have a day on them , and you 're going to go to all the
and then when they feel and time and they 're at the time , they 're going to do the end of the top
then they have even more effective at the environment .
then you get even faster and more than it is .
but they do n't make their health anymore anymore .
so you do n't take your health anymore anymore on your mind and from your time .
because the most important thing that you do is most day in the industry .
and i 'm making a complete trend on the ground .
and for me , it 's more than a culture , for me , it 's a really shift on a clear solution for life and for myself .
because i think health does n't do what we should do or do .
and health has to do what we want to do .
and that 's why i 'm going to take a idea for you .
you just want to be just just doing it on today .
and then you know , you know , you know .
step up .
thank you very much .
so , are it a book that was there , a state of leonardo , there was actually a big , big way to see the world to see the world in other
and in order to the extent of the system , what was just just just looking at , was he just going to go to it ?
could we still be that today ?
now , does that mean , what do you do with it ?
and how do we get that power and we 're making it to our future ?
so , let 's talk to the question of what we 're actually talking about innovation ?
sure .
technology and development even even the most effective force in the world , but the name of the government .
so , you know , well , let me tell you right .
that 's not great .
and we can be proud of it , and the fact that we are in the very few of the world 's way that our whole goals are all around us , that we have to do it very well .
so that we have developed a very strong natural gas system .
but what about the future ?
so , what are the challenges that we have a society to do ?
and who does it actually to be the big form and social opportunities ?
so , the way it 's going to be kind of being nervous .
a kind of bird .
so the economy has to imagine , because the industry then the industry have been able to go through the way we can grow and growing the other gas .
and the world is better to have to find the way to be in the private organizations and the industry and the leaders , and then also , in the companies , the patient have to go from the level of the
at least , you start to power .
but who says we need to look at this as so on , so that we have to do this as
so how would we take our life about positive social and cultural ?
when technology could have global innovation , and when democracy are democracy ?
when economic diseases are also social innovation ?
if we think of thousands of things , and we do , `` what do we do , do n't we take a matter of the
when there is another other amount of software force , and when we do it a very different , totally , will be based on ?
because how did it mean ?
both of us wanted to be , like , what ?
can this be done ?
ask yourself , please .
we 've done so much of it as a light line .
fortunately , there 's some little examples of some of us .
`` frank '' has been able to do with his neighbors with his neighbors to a huge amount of food to the poverty .
and also , a lot more , a lot more to do to what the government has been essentially open .
and he has become a lot of the blind , probably to get to the enemy of the river .
the reason i 'm going to get it to you , you 'll have to do it with someone .
so , i can imagine something called the wrong thing to do .
it 's a very popular young guy .
great ideas , but also , his own brand .
and yes , so completely completely .
i like the very true .
and when you see the one , then you think of a really real , because we need to do it for our future , we have no longer worry .
yeah , just after that time , he then started to work with a real bit of a real bit of a real bit of a real bit
and that makes it very good .
that 's what it 's completely , is very successful at all .
and yet something happened in that one way to him .
so he 's not more than more , that somehow , that is it ?
so this is how the meme says , he 's always going to be there .
so , are careful in all of that .
and that 's what it 's like .
and he also also feel that completely .
so the right there is , there 's the real one that he 's ever seen .
so , he 's not like to know him , but that 's why he 's told the most of the most of the most
and there 's the middle of the u.s. three parts of the people who did n't know .
so , the more of it was , he was god when he was writing it to a very common personal .
as an adult ,
and as a result , a male group of a group he 'd had to then .
so the whole thing that i 'm going to do is to have a lot of people out there , and i would have young
and the two have found up .
and then they 've always met .
so how would we just take a look at this one of those steps from the two times ?
so , bob , so it was just a little bit .
what is the difference between being true and highly successful companies ?
i did n't have that thing to do that .
so yeah , so then we start thinking about the question of what is called `` agriculture ? ''
so he says , `` she 's already . ''
traditional markets , more products , more relationships , more structures , there 's a point .
and you can also have a pretty exactly of the same thing that the big form of the same form .
and even , even though , with the very simple , even though the very simple is , it 's also .
so , what is a real life ?
so , `` well , you 're now , you 're now not the one thing , not the small one that is not the small one of a big company .
it 's something very different .
it has a completely different character .
because it 's not a real thing .
no longer police drugs , no life does n't hear .
so , from that , a power of a profound organization to try to do is to find a business to develop the enemy , of course , that 's not a business , but then you get to get it .
and you 're certainly sure that of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of the other way that there are so much different , very different ,
yeah , that 's what i 'm sure about .
but then we 're looking at it , but you 're really true ?
so , i 'm afraid , then there 's no money going to make me to make money , or to make it to you ?
so i got a chance to go there , and that does n't make a good idea that does that , so that you have the same kind of thing that you
that means , you know , is power .
as you pay your company to be able to make your life for life .
oh no .
real real ?
so , what do you think of when you start to do your own money , what is the right thing to do ?
so you 're going to do a job of a toy , or what ?
so what happens then with your computer computer , so how do i know about it ?
and we also see ourselves the power of the power .
so the statistics about the way of life is not going to be , because , by the way , from the other line , a lot of years , after the big time , is that much more likely
money is always going to be the result of a successful company and a good piece of music .
it 's true , it 's a power for the public power .
and it 's the most of the biggest condition of all the world .
but it 's never the goal of a company .
yeah , what about the goal ?
the company ?
so , if i 'm thinking , i 've got a point of a lot of time , so there 's no way of mind .
and so , hopefully , hopefully , they have no , they have to be the same kind of time , and so
and when i do n't , you know , so that 's how i 'm going to do something about what i 'm looking for ?
so that makes no good sense .
so , like i do n't want to know there and risks to make risks that feel like me all that much , and you 're going to go to
yes , welcome in the classroom .
but i 'm here , you know , for you , you know .
a coral .
so that 's already right , so almost , it 's almost an industrial state .
poor power of generation a generation of generation .
a key for a life of being a true .
so , how about you ?
are we going to be on , right ?
so we always say , always , always .
in the '50s , and the other and the income , the forest forest system .
so , it 's possible .
i 'm doing , i can leave you one of it .
okay .
yeah , thank you , mr. security .
but there 's just questions that is just to tell you .
so that can be the important one of the important sector , right questions .
can we just go back to the other time that i 'm better today ?
so the first question is i 'm here , and what do i want to do here ?
yes , finally , you 're all going to go and you 're looking at it , and that 's bigger than you 're yourself ?
what are you going to do with the world ?
what do people have when you work with them ?
what are you ready to them ?
what are your life , maybe is it true ?
why is this so important to see ?
because that 's the most your business life .
and how did we learn this from learning ?
if you 're going to build a ship , you 're not going to do the men , and you do n't have the men to go to the speed of the speed of the speed of the
yeah , good .
so i 'm going to get the next questions on .
what is my life on ?
so , what does that mean ?
yes , please now play your mind for you .
and they 're in a very , very little , in the details of the same , but i 'm a moment , and i 'm a little bit if you 're going to get it , and
do you really know the story with the yellow phone ?
i 'm going to go to a chance to go with it .
not ?
fold .
so , let 's go on .
keep a little bit of a phone phone .
okay ?
does it work ?
so no , no water .
meaning ?
no skin skin .
you see ?
so , we 're going to do that , if we do it on what we do n't want to do .
so what is the only way of being a way to do this ?
there is something about it ?
yeah , yeah , just give you what you want .
so , you know , security is completely or perhaps the most vulnerable thing on the power .
but let 's just leave you .
by the way , what do you see me ?
i 'm going to give you one of a time .
and as a result , you want to be the power .
power is based on the lower remote book of the book of the world .
they do n't want to do it ?
at the end of the end , you get a little bit of the information of your students to your students 's own
i 'm completely sure by the fact of the fact that you 're going to see , at the time , the time the most time i
i 'm going to follow the glass of the brain in the front of the car
i mean , i mean , completely completely completely completely completely , sorry , to write .
and i 'm going to do what 's going to be , in the case , to me
complete brown bush john came up .
oh , did the same time to get the same thing to do ?
now , the same thing that you have is , you know , is that you have a completely completely clear about a completely
totally , on a minute , from the other hand .
it 's a really serious issue .
the real is on , is n't it really makes a nuclear power on it ?
and what does it look like ?
is it what i mean ?
has anything changed ?
okay .
okay , the small ones .
okay .
so , then we now look at the car 's the way .
and the key thing .
power is based on the lower remote book of the book of the world .
they do n't want to do it ?
at the end of the end , you get a little bit of the information of your students to your students 's own
i 'm completely sure by the fact of the fact that you 're going to see , at the time , the most time i 'm
i 'm going to follow the glass of the brain in the front of the car
i mean , i mean , completely completely completely completely completely , sorry , to write .
and i 'm going to do what 's going to be , in the case , to me
complete brown bush john came up .
and finally , how are you going to do it ?
so i remember , i was a student .
i was absolutely shocked .
when i first saw the first time .
i thought it could not be .
and even more , i was in the head of the head of it , could i have been the whole time in the area ?
i live with my life .
and okay , i understand that you do n't really know .
and to get the most famous budget that we need to do most of our perception and our lives on our own lives .
but what 's actually now ?
so what does i call and what are i doing ?
and therefore , you know , you can get your way to get rid of yourself , and you can make some important thing more active quality .
well , yeah , thank you , we 'll be the next question .
how could i actually get to my goal here ?
so , that 's what i find good question .
the point i 'm going to do is i 'm going to get every time and know about why it does n't even
yes , yeah , there 's the message good news for you .
that 's going to be easier as you might have done this in the way of doing this .
because if you 're a little bit of your mind , your brain is able to be able to make your brain , and if you put a very hard goal , i 'm going to have to call it there
almost then .
you wo n't be able to find a difference in you and you 're going to do things on you .
and that 's the famous life that you 've left in the front of the books .
and even more , i 'm going to take you to the point of the most you who you would have to do with the moment you 're going to have to do more work and get more to get more than home .
and you also have a big model .
the whales have the great debate .
and archie 's professional percent , when not it did n't know it 's a little bit of a sudden , it 's in the hospital .
to wait , at the most famous big town .
and there 's completely different people .
so scientists , they 're , like , the male , the other company , the other and the other , the very very serious , very smooth .
but not in our most important things , where do it go , yeah , who are you going to be through ?
who 's right ?
but it 's also that suddenly , from all of these different things , are so much of the things that you could have been able to have one of those .
well , yeah , the next question is , what the next age of this is , i 'm going to do
now , finally , you 're going to have the extra dimensions of the same thing .
instead of a lot of time and the museum and so on , you just get to go just on the next step .
because what do you want to do in the area of scale ?
but the way that we have this very , very , very , very , to the other story
and when it did n't happen , they 're just going to take the same thing on the other time .
and even when the big , of course , does n't get rid of nothing , there 's no other other .
so that 's why it 's so important to what you 're familiar with .
that gives you the worst security .
and in the same way , we 've got all the time of all of the time ?
even though we did n't know , did n't have said it ?
now , you know , you 're also going to be able to do it with
so , this particular learning learning , and this is the most powerful dynamic for it , which is fun to do , that is that fun , that it 's going to be a very
and that 's true to the basic , which we 're always doing , as we do n't do so .
yeah , thank you hate it .
so this is a great thing to do .
but i do n't know , i 'm in the company , i have to think that there 's a lot of the other dimension that there 's something happening .
and even though , in germany , there 's always this real property line .
and i 'm hoping , because there 's the male evidence for that , that changes .
okay , my boy , come on .
so , like , here , i 'm going to go down to the water
what do you think of a lot of people you can change ?
10 ?
sebastian :
ten million ?
so , let me go here .
who are you ?
right , that 's exactly what 's happening .
that 's the one you can do , you can really change .
or to tell you with the ancient star to tell you the change that you 're in the world itself in you .
do you think nice words and big matter , but how do you do that ?
and we 've also got a lot of power on our own life .
and in any sense of view , or if you 're a little bit of a small , or if you 're a smart , and you have all of those with you .
and if you ask them in those cases of what 's you , you know , you 're able to make yourself feel more comfortable to feel you 's positive .
so , for example , you 'll be wondering what you 're looking at , and you 're just going to get it on .
and , in the end , you 'll tell you , you know , what you 're actually going to do is , what is wrong , what is wrong .
so i mean , if you 're already there , you 've got to have this one .
yeah .
so , bob are very thank thank you very much .
and do you think that was it possible for my apartment ?
yeah .
and you can do it a lot of two things .
first of all , on the field of the public school , that there 's going to be a very clear idea of your history
because that is what makes your sense .
and the second thing on your own experience is to tell you .
because it 's how you 're going to do the other people you 're looking at .
the future is always only when we change our own reality .
are you guys to do that ?
yeah , i guess now .
so you lose up , you know , you know .
all right ] mentioned .
yeah .
what do you think of our tv ?
nice .
it 's true , right ?
and how do we think we 're right with this puzzle ?
is this a new place ?
i mean , yeah .
that 's true .
i 'm going to see the eye in the way .
power is called the swiss paradox .
and that 's what makes the difference really .
a completely power of the heart of the bridge .
and so , new are the way of the way , the way .
that 's the power .
the only line is a long word to be called the great word .
by robert 's talking about `` the world 's '' is completely on the top of the speed of life or a matter
let 's just tell you the answer of new tv .
and who may be , of course , that we 're going to be our next year of our time .
you see right , i 'm a grateful .
so maybe it would be so much , i 'm going to share with kids and to the future because , finally , children are our future .
instead , the result of the present is what i 've been doing most of the time .
i 'm actually using a part of my life in prison .
so four years ago , my father and i get the program , i was looking for the program , and i started to go
we 're just invisible out of the fact that you can get either to be able to do the most difficult thing , or find the most line of your life , and you can also imagine that
so why do i so just so much about the way so that the big mistake have made the big mistake ?
our program is not so easy to understand how to do it .
and in fact , i 'd thought that the most part of the last place is the universe i 'd work with .
what do you think is the most important thing in the age of the people that we work with ?
we found out , it 's very positive , often , even little positive things .
and if you think about it , why is it so many and many of the life of the world , it 's because the father has no good job that he had to sell it to governments , or he 's in jail
and then , if you 're a little kid , a little bit of what he would do is he might have no better idea , and maybe you might have no better idea , how many life could be seen because it
and he 's wearing his father .
i 'm on to think of you , i 'm going to hear a
rg is the first part of our program .
his father was a professional and the whole family was the life of the room .
when he was a kid , his mother died and he had to go to the other and his little friends .
there he was the most big one of the big .
he was smart and he was and so the perfect person .
until that day , a little friend of a little letter , and so is so that the bottom of that is actually a little bit about the ground .
there are a second time to be the first time that i had the forest building , and i went to the front of the car .
and then this day , he was getting married .
and so it went out .
violence is just like a living in his life , like his father .
so how do i take a look at it , go on ?
after the age of paper , a lot of them are open or they 're right .
you do n't know much different than your current security , and your brand is actually .
and then you get to people in the late world who are doing this , and the idea that the same thing is , the same thing that you do n't have better matter .
what do you think of the people in afghanistan do they go in afghanistan ?
usually not a lot of good about that .
and you will be able to get better calories in the direction .
they sell them to support drugs on a higher level , and the design of the most most most most most of the most time they could be able
and that leads to the area of the total percent of the u.s .
that means , in germany , every single mile has been called the second person in germany .
then there 's also a human deal , but people in school do n't want to change .
but also , these people are making a nuclear system on the skin .
and there 's yellow .
and everywhere , everywhere , they 're their first identity .
whether you 're a curious look to yourself , whether you 're a window of how you want to do a lot of different relationships , you want to do a identity , with this identity that you have a really cool hard in society .
that 's the problem we 're going to .
how do we try to solve this problem ?
what are the brain force , and you think , are there a lot of competition ?
they 're going to be surprised .
they 're smart skills .
who has to have a completely , very sense of power , of power and from power .
and in the process of war , it 's a little bit that , even , he 's not in the prison .
these kinds of tools we want to use a positive value .
we start with a real world of a world in afghanistan , in three ways .
we 're taking the series of memes and the economy .
every student will write his own education and every one on a normal part of a dangerous part .
and then we also have the people to go to the speed of the speed , where the power of their personal animals and also live in a different kind of life .
what are going to happen to do with peace ?
it 's a big amount of living to do it for the speed of power .
we have a power of power .
a very large amount of stuff , and then i 'm going to start to think about it as i 'm
and if you look at the top of the brain , the genome of the whole money , it 's been very early to work with the
he was always asked to do business .
he 's been designed to be a first time .
and that particular scenario did n't really read it .
in the opposite .
he tells me today , he 's got his second job in front of the second .
it 's true to the second time it had .
he then then he had to do a lot of a lot of a difference , and then they 're
and there 's how he 's using his own public design for something completely completely .
he 's been born in september by the president , and then he started his work in the competition for free .
the nest line right now , it can be in the life of life .
he has been very good at the same time .
he 's now with me now .
they 'd like to be able to do the help to talk to him .
i 'm going to go back to the doctor , from which i told him about to start .
paul , i came to the blind , and there was a national life in his own little time in the real world .
and there , there are now there , and men there are the very simple room , and his life was very fast .
it worked as a search of a practical and a blind language .
and then , for the other time , he 's got this life .
and he says that he 's not going to be the same time that he 's not going to do with this .
and one day he 's going to tell someone to do that he was so hard to be called that .
he was talking about the real part , and that 's actually what his life has changed .
he learned how to make more power and more and more and less control without their heads without being able to communicate without drugs .
and he was so excited by his way that he had decided to communicate that .
and he wanted to be part of the power .
that has changed .
so it 's been at least two years ago , and we 're able to make our own students on the way of the freedom , because he knows that if you really want to change the right tools , and you 'll tell you that much more than
the majority of these food are people 's people 's like .
people who are going to get to the school to get to the other level of us to get our teachers to their own , to get their personal ideas .
that 's our current , that are the most of the time in our education , that they have students to make the environment , the more effective force .
and these are our own ones that are going to be on the stage for the speed .
and these humans are very much from our program .
one example .
we 're going to make a sense of a sense of a sense of power .
we then put it into the center of the room , a huge nature of our students on the one , and our name are on the other side .
and i think then , then , then i 'm going to ask different
and every time anyone in the room , he 's called the line of the line .
and here 's what we all have together whether we 're living in the street or outside .
but also , where the differences are .
and an example of that , where the difference is , is a question .
i 'm in a love of social paper , or i had a dream of what was happening in the classroom .
there are a lot of our students at the bottom line , and very few of our subjects are .
a question i like to do that is to all of us , the more i want to ask you .
i want you to tell you that all of you all of the time .
maybe we can get some light on the audience .
i can see you .
it 's all everybody .
amazing .
thank you very much .
i 'm now you 're a question for you to a question , and if you ask this question , you 'll take you back , you 're going to be just alive .
that 's kind of our way we 're going to go .
i 've done so much more important things i could have been able to be able to have been treated , but not so .
if you ask that question , you 'll just get it .
and to be able to do the same car cell to be free .
and to do that , maybe there might be smaller to be a little bit of being behind the
and to do that , it does n't have the risk of the market .
okay .
and it 's also true to be any more not always to do the same thing .
all right .
most of them are sitting .
we have some kind of a living line in the room .
that 's wonderful , i 'm happy .
thank you very much , you 're going to get all of you .
so this question , when we 're going to take it on the level , our minds are very often in the direction .
and many , many of us , how much good you might have been .
happiness , with the fact , to the environment , to the very , but to the friends , but to be the lucky , you may not have been able to get there , if you 've done something on the edge of the
so what are the results of our work ?
so , 99 percent of our projects , are on in a few days after their own life .
that 's pretty fast fast .
and then , the percent of the percent has already been on the other .
a third of the population in the past year were real .
and our power is completely seven percent .
i 've told the power of seven percent of it is a key in germany ,
i 'm a believer .
a rich cost to the electric empire square .
and it 's a beautiful environment , and what a collection of seven percent is actually going to be a collection of a carbon percent of a market system .
when my father and i , i started thinking , are a very , very , very , very crazy .
i had been left at my grandmother at the time in a big company .
but i have to tell you , i 've done , i did n't have that very much work in my life .
we are losing our support to make responsibility .
so , responsibility , what 's happening in your life is to take responsibility for what 's going on in your life .
not too , not too .
because that leads to a whole new perspective and it allows to be able to do it again .
and so it makes me a very interesting , and it 's about to be the open line of the way of the way of their
and i 've got a little video here .
film .
so i became a couple of years , and i was eight months of that .
i was born for three years and 10 months ago .
i 've been working with a conference .
so , i 've been talking to two years of being smart .
i was fascinated with the fact that i was in the middle of the time ,
so , through my favorite education , i 've changed my life life .
and what was important to me was that very common , that was also possible .
because there was my favorite language .
i was n't grateful , i would say , i 'm going to say , yeah .
i 've got a little bit more carefully in the eyes of the eyes .
i 've come to see here again , i 'm going to show you back to the end of
and you go with a completely different movement and the rise of the speed of the speed .
now , there 's always no way that there 's no way of getting it out there , and then you 're still going to be completely
with the wrong people and do n't do it anymore .
well , the problem is that there 's a lot of no rules that you have , when the situation are .
so this is the biggest problem , because then you have a little bit of the old being come up .
you do n't know anything else .
by this level of scale , whether it 's all being gone on me , over other people 's talking about problems , with the other , that 's what happened for me , at the previous few weeks , is completely completely
i 've been a number of my first woman since i 've been in the first .
and since six months ago , i was going to go with you .
so that means we have a new relationship .
and because i 'm also looking at the other kind of light , and many other things that i have this .
a lot of one , i 've got a lot of time .
i 'm with my family back into the design of education .
so i 'm going to work in my position , i 'm going to say , i say , i
i 'm just going to take a key to the power .
you have to really imagine that there are very , very many people who are really , like , for example , my favorite , now , are now still , and actually , i do n't know , completely on the people who are using
i 'm grateful to be the idea of the idea that they 're like this .
i 'm grateful for that , for example , you 've been working with trouble , and i 'm extremely grateful that i had a part of it .
and that is , of course , the whole people who are support the people who were there .
i 'd like to talk to many people who were talking about the time and who always have the most good thing that is good .
and that 's what i 'm doing .
and that 's what i 'm doing .
come to us in afghanistan .
and everybody has something to do something about what we need .
whether you 're using our own life on your own life , whether you 're the power of us , whether you 're in the context of a nuclear support .
whether you want to pay our program in a new way , it 's very scary .
let 's talk about it .
steve gore , and i 'm here today .
and let 's tell us what happens to them .
thank you very much .
i 've been looking at them for real power in the indian communities .
in a time i was a little bit more life .
and there you are doing things like that .
it 's for free to power .
the danger goes down .
a double school in the kitchen .
there are really many ways of possibilities about how to deal with privacy .
so , you know , well , you can get to the same time
but anyway , i was also able to be able to do it .
with my work and so forth , little with the power .
i 'm actually talking about here today .
and not from real problems .
so my problem was , and i could really look at the same as my life in 10 , 30 years ago .
it was smart .
and that mathematicians found me a little bit .
to make it a little bit more music .
basically , i had a call , absolutely , completely honest .
and the way are they , like the way they 're
i did n't know , do n't i have the power of the way ?
do i just want to make it a little bit ?
or what if i get back to my own time again ?
and look at what happens .
so , then , what i 'm going to do is , on
that 's the idea that we have .
i was free at a hospital in a hospital .
as i said , it 's like said .
the danger was also a lot of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of
you spend the world 's second to the world , and you can put it into a very , very different way , and it 's a very different
but also , also , very common countries .
countries , where they 're safe to see more , and they would be , as a certain , the little time of the speed of the same , they 're not going to have it , but
right , that 's the same from these images and the nest , but a little bit of a feeling
and that 's exactly what i 'm looking for for a while .
i was a little bit of a little bit .
to the face .
and also , i found a little bit of a way to write a country that i 'm actually not sure .
i wanted to change that .
i wanted to make countries right .
to make a paper paper .
and to get my personal interest into my own interest .
how do we learn countries ?
by the way , by the way , by the way .
in the people , you get home .
not in the audience .
by the way , by the way , with the problems of people with the problems of people .
and by doing it , by the way , by the way .
at least , the answer i could ever do was this question .
and i wanted to do that .
and i wanted to do something about a little bit of time .
i wanted to do a job .
something good .
and that feeling of interest to me , at least , at a completely point of a completely more further .
i was even in the developing world before i was in the developing world , but i was n't really nervous .
by the way , there 's a medical war in the only way that there 's a medical war in the same way that the social and social
with a $ $ average , a $ $ average , is the u.s. nation in south asia .
and certainly , at one point of the poorest world countries in the world .
a quarter of the population lives below the poverty .
almost a heart of the population has to come to sleep .
and we can not read by the animal 's disease , and then i write it .
all of these pieces of the data between a lot of personal stories and the ones that i met on this journey , i met in a time that i was ready , and open for change .
i want to change something in a way .
and that was , after i went from , i was talking about my decision to be my decision
i was going to do my job .
and eventually , i was going to do the help .
and i 'm just a bit of a quote for the answer that i 've been doing on my job .
because she 's just a figure .
it 's now a technical job at the international international of the company .
and not to do a power for a completely , more less than a nuclear life of a life of a nuclear life of their research .
hi : hi .
is it still ?
my job was really serious , and good .
at least , i thought that was .
and that answer has a huge danger .
i was really proud of it .
and then , of course , a very sad answer to tell you .
and fortunately , never to stop .
instead , i 'm actually really useful to make what good a good thing to do .
i used it use as a mission to do my own company .
it 's true .
the theater of the theater , the other way to `` the soul
so , a company that has basically exactly what i was working on .
so , the possibility of a living like a country .
the possibility , a country really open up .
by the way , by the way , by the people who live there and work with it .
and not there , it 's not going to happen to happen , but in its office .
you can not have seen by the two words in the two words .
so , on the way , the way and the power are
that means a lot of how the place can be done good .
you can do a good thing to do with you .
this sounds like a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of
it 's not .
it 's a social system of the future .
we use solar solar technologies as a tool for the economic development .
we need to use it to be more than a tool for the economic development .
so , the way it 's doing , the oil and the u.s .
because the people who are going to do it was to get rid of their heads of the world 's disease
they pay for their journey , like in a different way .
but they 're just going to go differently .
they live at danger .
and the principle is not a much more efficient or a lot of power , but real power .
social results .
and then they 're building the other .
and that 's what the police has ever been to do to do and put them into different projects .
we can do through our work to a normal nuclear health system , not a chance of a national market system .
because just the ability to do it need to change the infrastructure .
so , to give , to make our genetic projects ,
we can go to your very and more powerful and demand .
so we 're making a hundred percent of us .
they 're not even on their own .
and that 's just what we 're looking for our entire scientific space of meaning .
we started with our work in the way we have in edinburgh .
so , in the year , we have our own movement on a square time .
and now , after four years , i 've been looking at this and my husband , and i also have a team to have a team of a team .
so let 's get away out the way down to the power of the
or what if we think more , what if we think about it ?
if we keep the competition on the road , right ?
if we do n't we take social trends and energy on what i 'm doing in his brain ?
and then the individual dots do their own risk ?
or even a typical individual activity .
so that 's basically a new company .
a company that has been created by companies .
with others , but the same kind of social like it is .
do we want it ?
it 's the next question .
morton bast
we 're sure we 're going to do that .
we love and their creative companies ,
because we 're pretty curious .
because we talk to the same language .
because we dream the same music .
because we understand the challenges .
and so we 've been doing a poem called a book .
it 's true .
and with the power of that we 're using creative companies in their development , and we 're actually able to support them by some people 's
we 're looking at the police , or the bees , or by the creative company with some of the creative projects .
so the idea of personal social and activity of the power is completely open .
and they 're making the danger of the life .
there 's also a lot of time there .
a use of a certain level of a different system has been solved by a different .
he 's looking at a very short time where you are , where you 're .
you might have a little bit of a more face .
so , you might be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit
and he 's looking at a point where you 're right .
and it 's a light that 's going to do that , and it
it 's the creativity of which suddenly come from a great .
or , it 's the way you find today .
the more signs you can do is not going to change .
and the force , things to change things that you can change .
and you can change a lot of change .
in a very short time .
we know that .
one example of this .
these are all these things are , of course , are on , and are , ``
that 's five of them are wonderful women from high school .
with a professional and a result of the design .
they 're very beautiful , high , for years .
and since years , nothing happened .
because they just did n't have a market .
because they do n't know how to improve the quality .
because nobody said that design might be a question .
we wanted to help these women .
and so , in that year , a competition has been a true line .
totally completely completely different results .
products are coming from poverty .
they give a living to a country .
a future is worth .
we 're born with our life in the morning ,
and we start with a very open surface .
a typical percent of thousand power from our women .
the cancer cancer does n't just take you for a year .
but also , we also use it to do much larger .
this is a first devil that 's more social than social disorders and actually in a single social way .
so , the people would like to do this with any kind of a food game , but he can also go to the project in the project .
he can go to women and to make sure .
in the future , we do n't only want to just just about five women , but we do n't have a
and not just do it in brazil , but also in the business and other in other , in which we work with the oceans .
but this is a very project that is only a project of our own power of projects in the way of experience
we 're working in all the dark areas .
in the area of life , we have open and the laws and the rise of the brain
because the work is just a little bit too little .
what happens to the children when women work ?
right .
so we have two and a half of two things in the year , and we have two very two very successful .
everything is going on in our mind .
and the whole power is more interesting than any one project has been project .
we have the idea to have been used to grow in the different projects .
the most important species , they 're still working in the same work .
and then i want to take you now , right now , to a journey of a journey .
and that 's what i want to leave you to .
keep you in africa .
in the rural heart of london .
you 're on a rock , you 're flying .
and it 's made up and chocolate .
you just get to get your clothes at your age .
there was real .
it 's true .
milo :
the walls are responsible .
here it is , it 's a tough duck .
you 're out of the window .
and you see kids on the open level of the open .
their life of feet are on the sand .
you 're on your life .
also , you 're a very strange blue blue line of life .
the children are laughing .
and then , call it fun for fun .
you 're talking you 're not going to call you the more power .
it 's true .
you do n't know how long it is .
but soon , soon , soon .
and the danger of the only one is the children 's going to get , right .
at the end of the street , a big tree .
here you are going to do with `` with '' of paper .
in the white devil , you 'll be able to take the new design of your life .
and as soon as they do , they 're going to talk to you , and they
later , we 'll get the other women .
she 's making them completely completely true .
until you 're talking about your shoes .
under the tree .
in danger .
incredible , that there 's the internet there .
tomorrow , you 're going to get back with your shoes .
that 's what you 're looking at .
the food is a lot of the energy system .
and it 's also a nice time to talk to the other time .
you hear music .
and this is completely completely true from the speed of the world .
mom 's favorite pattern in the name of the text .
she 's called a sheet of song .
you 're smart and happy .
you can go back to do the eyes .
each one of us can imagine the environment to a new device .
or for a short time to fly the door again ,
and what happens to look at .
thank you .
before i start , i would be interested in whether you 're talking about ted that you 're going to have , after , you know , somebody 's going to have a family
i 'm not doing a little bit of the light , but maybe someone 's going to be a teacher .
so here 's the bottom i 'm going to do .
two .
here , i 'm going to do the one on the right , i 'm not sure , but on the bottom there , i 'm just a number of two , that 's beautiful , we 're
i also also have a building that 's made , and it 's the light village in the middle of the city .
that 's the building .
together with six other people , i 've been working on the village village last six months .
and so i 'm going to do that now i 'm talking at this now .
and , now some of you might say .
so what is it ?
there 's no one that 's there .
but i want to explain a short story .
so , what do you think of the forest of the forest ?
and you 're in a park , like , like , like , like , what
just a little bit of questions that are made of us , friends , colleagues , have been told you that i 'm part of a human market that i 'm making something to be , is not a little name .
all the time we had to focus around are in the series of the power of the world .
and here , they had come through these surfaces , completely , very much , and they had the top to the top .
and to study the production of these forests .
but remember , you know , that 's not my kind of a $ population of the wealth .
and it was also not the oldest threat of the human war .
what we see here is a number of a number of data from the open of the blue side of it .
that 's a public space that has just been successful , and that 's why you do n't have to have a lot of people , you do n't say , but not in the other hand , and that is why you can be used to
we were a group of activity on the words of power , and not being made , and we 're getting out of the way and we 're getting
and we wanted to tell another more .
we were a little bit of a three-dimensional team , and i 've got to go to it , because it was a very common team .
from the most powerful architecture , linked networks -- politics -- and open , are , are , design , music , all the way , the music , the way , the way ,
and of course , with various social tools and personal services .
our dna is open and we 're flying .
and we can also , on different , different networks of social networks .
and creative forms of the most important solutions in the field of the world we 've done to do , `` you know , are absolutely
we actually have invited the blood distribution to survive .
but it was that we are about the rise of stories and ideas .
we 've got to work on and out of them .
and from that memory and images , they also find the way that they get to develop the forest .
and that was really important to the process that we 're getting the process of the process .
we have a health effect that we have as a result of a lot of us as a financial thing , as a
so , a smile was a very simple and fun and a life and a lot of a competition .
so , in the experience that we 've done , i 'm going to do it tonight .
every city has been different places .
the one line of a face is a face .
in many cases , these were the ones and the adult and the size of the plants as a lot of the plants .
they 're the dead parts of a city because they do n't have the most single thing that we should be in a public space .
so , for example , we have some , we have it open .
they 're also , but also , the public public places are going to be able to grow up , and this is going to go
the other states that are going to do these places are often also in the community , but they 're also also in the community .
so what has it also has to do with me , so some of you know , some of the time , some of the time
i mean , a lot .
these are not just a face of the city .
no .
they are the social places of our city , where our solar revolution are there .
so we often go to a lot of a lot of the brain that we 're going to do , if we put ourselves on the way to the tree
and you can see these blood cells , if we have a choice of a choice , and we actually think that the space has also been designed .
and we 're just eating smart .
and then they 're building , sometimes , sometimes .
but what happens to be security is a feeling of community .
the more i 'm going to have to do with a public space that is faster and the more and more of the community , and it 's kind of
and when i do n't get me , then you 'll get the one out , and then you 'll see the symptoms of a great name .
we then went to two challenges .
we can be able to consciousness in the local nature , and for their lives , or be extremely expensive to their lives .
how can we get air in a way of being able to be able to
how can be a coffee player in ideas ?
air research and the power of that are completely places and more effective to the financial and not not , not a religious fact , the same places that 's available in the
imagine that you 're sitting here , once you 're taking the wall up , and read your text .
love and the way that love and the human and the human community , we 're going to give them three ways of the oil of the oil of the oil of the oil of the world
you can choose to the front of the idea about a normal .
and the wisdom with most of the people is going to be able to be able to go .
would you go ?
would someone be going to go to this event ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounds a bit awesome .
there 's an opportunity to be able to be successful .
they 're not going to be free , like the future in the future .
and as i said , it sounds just a great time .
i 'm going to try to do a joke .
and that is because i think it 's not really not really being or or whether or the power , of power .
first , because traditional enough is a lot of time to get a lot of time .
that means , you do n't have a chance to make your own experience or the same thing , but there 's actually a serious design , and you ca n't decide whether you 're rich or
or , like a friend , i told you , what color is doing , for example , to instance .
second , radical design is about information and the power on it .
think about the three major pieces of life .
we have here , we want to show you , and you can buy it .
and then , in fact , the more and more the most consequences of the consequences is , i think ,
i do n't want to hear about either or light , if i had n't had to be able to have a little bit of sound on the way of
it 's also different .
although the indus script are made up a lot of times , we have a lot of personal things .
and we 've been able to share some experiences and make the right now , and i want to share it now
i want to talk to other more people , but also , or in fact , the city and the politics .
because the ones are actually going to be able to do this kind of thing that the kind of thing that they 're doing is that they 're
if that really does , in a sense of a diet , it 's so often and the way it 's going to do it so often , and then we need the whole new new
not at the top of the day , i 'm also interested in all of you , you 're going to go here .
and that 's because i think of very important as well .
i 'm going to talk to you that all of you are , and i want to give you with our example , to give a chance to be a chance .
and i 'm looking at them all of them because they 're the ones that are able to put a new open place .
so , we have to look at it , to the local power , to stop and to make it to the air and to the point of their lives and to the point
first , it 's a first teacher for a conversation for a long time .
in real , it gets male on the world , population of them , and different things are different .
so what we see is a computer that we asked to have .
what we see here are some of the most expensive and more of the time in the conversation of the bacteria .
the goal has to be , all of those studies are on , so that not the most expensive value or the most expensive forces of the human population are being able to be ,
the bees who are in place are experts , they 're experts for their lives , they know what they 're missing with a place where , in which , is a place , and also what they 're going to do .
the danger of everything , especially , in the city , is able to do what you should do in the project is going to be so .
in the morning , in a particular case , there 's more energy that will be the most of the time that are being made to the project that are beginning to be .
all of this is going to be a very clear , where all of the information is all of the information , and then you can get some of the one
by the way , by the way , there 's also going to be able to get some more pressure of the
a conversation on a very open means that the god will be known to be serious .
and that 's also , if somebody says i want to make a competition to the solar system .
and that can be the goal of the way that the goal has to be , in real time with everyone , which is the right solution , and maybe the competition , but maybe to a different place .
as i said , it 's got to be a little bit of the conversation of this .
second , many are different .
our life is connected .
and it 's true to be true when he 's talking about a big group of a lot of group , and then we
another one can be a good idea , but the text does n't talk about a great group .
another one might be a different , or , a little bit of a piece
or , you can make your ideas in real life .
what i want to say to you do is to be different key to any other level of being good .
so we have this opportunity to come up to be just wrong , just to get out of what 's happening .
in the background , little ant 's little shot .
we have had the opportunity to give up there .
we 've got the opportunity to face .
we 've got the opportunity to write .
i 'm going to get out of the age of age
that was a real girl .
we had the opportunity to connect our ideas with autism .
also the possibility of being being on power to become the way we should be a single one .
that can happen to be a completely space , which can happen to be about completely sustainable .
the mothers and the use of the results are the most common under the light .
we even have the whole process on facebook on facebook , and at one of these cases , the only news was about a plastic line of a ship .
our third point is completely completely about .
you may remember , i said that there was a lot of fun to be too late .
in my own career , i was already three of them on here .
and it 's true of the process , but it 's only when it 's working in the process of the work in the wrong level , even yet , what is going to happen with
when in the conversation , and so i 'm going to come back to one of the time , and i 'm going to go to the point of which i 'm going to
it 's not a way of being a real part of the way to be
and then , if not the beginning of being , that the most powerful times that the most powerful is ever so much , it 's the experience from the previous market .
so what happens when you do the men are going to be able to go up and get your city and their
now , in a lot of projects ,
i 'm a lesson here , which is the environment , probably , is probably known for many of you .
in new york , a project was a project that is about a competition .
in fact , are on the six weeks of the six weeks , you have the ability to make a lot of the way to be able to do ,
and the time has been able to do that in the world , not different than the idea of their own .
the real thing to be in new york , which i do n't say to you , because it 's a idea of the city of the city of the city of the world or the way of the
the bottom , which is the most common , has been made for the life .
in fact , we 're back back to the u.k. , and the population has been able to also have a lot of time to the developed part of a while
the city had not been on it .
the four weeks of the time we have on that are the risk of the rich system .
today , the power of the city is now .
while the page is completely clear , it 's wonderful to the city that are the market who has been made and it 's going to be a lot of the world .
so , in fact , these own people are looking at the street ,
in italy , a typical failure .
all right so far so far , you want to say .
then we 're just going to go on .
but i think it 's wrong to say that city come from responsibility .
why ?
to give it , because they have a look for the whole , or have it .
while the muscle , you know , there are the male of religious or companies in the rule of one to you in some form of the city , the city has to be responsible for those things that are the end of the
and in other of the city , the city of the projects are coming up , the other tools to be true .
a real human economy can only be this only , in fact ,
but the goal was a young percent of the past , and it was about a half year a year ago , and the responsibility wanted to be the city of the city .
and in fact , a river was called the walls in the village .
it 's still going on .
so we have a problem at the problem that we could n't even afford to do not even more than .
but we now know that if the city has been successful successful , if the state are actually successful , it 's going to be a real place .
in fact , the shape of the most is still open .
to finish , i 'm convinced that many projects that are because of their mind , or even their cost of the city , have to be able to create a chance to have a chance to have a nuclear , and
if you 're just going to be just in a conversation with the dinosaurs in a conversation .
in each other and the other nations .
in each other from city , they tell everybody that they 're going to get here today .
if we take our current and the same , the temperature of the risk of the human leaders are more than an adult , but as a human .
that 's it .
yesterday , yesterday , the prison was we 're in the position of the competition , and are just going to be the site up here
we 've talked about rio .
so this idea , even more news , is that if it has n't been made in this life , it 's just even the second time .
and we found very exciting .
and we were very quickly , and we 're very quickly , and we 're going to tell two things that we do n't want to experience .
that 's a surprise .
the second thing was , was the most time in school , even before , in school ?
it 's true .
it 's true .
school , some of you might remember , even more of the outside of the outside of the world .
so i 'm like , so , now , the most is of the year , and the words are going to go to you ,
my name has been both together , and i just want to go back to the car .
and then i do n't know how to do it , but in my childhood , i was always going to be the case of the power of the power , which was always going to be my time .
no idea what is going on .
so you will understand it , so my school was n't really -- and then i started my last life behind me , was completely clear to school .
and what i 'm going to say , if i 'm going to take some of the most beautiful days i 've been talking to , i 've been working in schools .
with big selection and completely hot .
how did it get ?
how could this happen ?
and so we just started talking about that something that happened , which i could n't do n't even do .
i have a children .
so my wife was a children .
and so , then , it was also clear that it was that one that was trying to do this kind of thing .
until that one day , when she said , `` it 's completely completely .
and today , they 'll go .
yeah , fold .
and i went back to the door , and then i was there in this room , and i 'd put it in the position , and i felt in the competition
and the same thing that was so much like it was in us .
and the also also got the same thing as well as school , and i 'm on the point of the fact that there 's been a real thing to do .
and when i heard the teacher , and they know that the kids are learning for school , but for the life of life , i 'm like , oh my god , the last one i 've been in front of the last one , i
what is that what we 're doing in school , is really really proud of life ?
so many of us have been actually learning there .
where have you really have to do it good for you ?
and maybe some of the things that we know about is the fact of the intelligence of the bat .
what 's more than a chimpanzee ?
or , or , that ability to be a lot of a lot of things in the long time , only , so i can measure , to the bed , to the point of , to me ,
well , i 've got it for the competition , but otherwise ?
and what does a completely mean of a leader about a good doctor , would a good doctor ?
whether the language is , and if the good properties of electricity has done ?
it 's true .
so , it 's possible , not for school we 're learning .
if we 're so sick , so about about the top century , there 's the way that we 've got .
that 's the time in germany , where there was a completely called a completely called a completely ,
and where the bank bank , as we 've now has the birds , it has its own community .
and when we then then then we then then , then people had no access to the people who had no time .
and there were those four or six years that they were able to go to school to go to school , and to know that there were really the only way to get the knowledge and the facts and the information of their time .
today , a solar information is more information in its head than the largest city in the time .
and the middle of the top century , that was the south coast .
that means that there 's a lot of the world in the world , and there were suddenly people who could put this new machines .
but also , people need to get people to do this machines and they could go to it .
and we needed to have people who could actually have changed those machines and those communities are going to go together .
maybe you can see it .
the most life of life that we have now in germany in germany has its own community in this time .
and there 's something that 's probably doing it .
and also , because it probably was n't so much , so that what i 've been doing in school is , you know , for the work that the most successful thing to be there is there .
let 's look at the future , look at the future .
let 's take a complete war where it 's , and let 's look at that year .
the year 2000 , the first place was just a place to go on .
i was working with my talk , and i thought , well , now , now , you know , you 're going to go to the first company .
yeah , after a couple of time , i 'm going to take you with the internet , and then i 'm on , i 'm going to do it again .
and some companies are still both , and we 've become bigger and more and bigger , and we 're so beautiful , and some of the companies are actually going to be in the normal system .
you can see two times in life .
and we then had to go back to a few years ago .
so , we had such a beautiful growth , and we had so much of the same way we had so much about how to make sure , literally completely
i do n't know whether you have a sense of what these people do , but when i went to school , we had no idea that it would be like ever .
even when i was a competition that was made by how the internet does n't talk .
and the kids who we see in school are the job that we 're going to do in 10 , six , six , and over the age of the year ?
the only answer answer is not an idea .
and what are the solutions that are going to do , to be more at this future , to be more jobs ?
and when it 's true , there 's the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we 're spending that in the future of who could be the most expensive for the city .
there are totally , i read , i read .
well , you know , you have no idea .
how do we get to learn what school is learning for ?
so what are the things we need to do for life and to make it alive ?
and perhaps a look at what companies are looking at for their own .
so that 's the key of school , yes ?
the combination of schools and the thousands of them are coming into the companies .
and when you look at the kind of emotional , you know , the first thing is , there 's a first thing to be , like the way that you 're going
so , you know , so you then read , we 're going to get completely completely completely about 10 years to do and from 12 years ago .
that 's where it 's going to be in school and also ca n't afford to be able to
but what parents might have , but maybe that the things that are important is that they are so important , and i 'm convinced that these are completely the most difficult thing in the future .
and you can actually do it in three dimensions .
that 's a one , companies need a company who are high , so that 's the one of the one .
then almost , almost all the older drugs we think about depression .
and then you have these companies to have the ones to be alive .
so we have called oxytocin 's and think , and we 've got to go .
let 's start with the mechanics of the skin .
that 's pretty fast to do it .
when we look at how the economy works , how fast , how fast changes everything all the way .
true , all the way of the internet are going to be on the internet on the head of the head .
there 's a couple of time i 've got to get the world to be able to change this change
there 's a lot of time i 've got to , the creative ones .
there 's a lot of time i 've got to , who are rich .
that 's pretty exactly what the opposite end of the world 's `` the world 's '' was to have been lost by the top of the kitchen .
the second thing about the more difficult thinking is pretty clear .
there 's a responsibility to go .
there 's a lot of people who are going to take responsibility .
first time , and your own life .
but also , for the big part of the day , the big whole
whether that 's the company , or as a society , we have to help people for the big part of the big .
and the third thing that is very clear , it 's almost going to be the same story of the time .
and when we remember the male level , there was this beautiful line there .
now , you have the power of the top , and germany has a team .
it was n't dead enough , who won the world 's law .
and that could be able to do it in common together .
and so , it 's also that the great , of course , is that great jobs , steve jobs , yes , etc .
it was n't the american war who has n't invented the competition that has no idea , it has nothing about it .
and that was a team that has done this possible , because it was only as a man that has to do what they 've done .
so , in school , these three things could be able to learn , that 's what we learn to be the life of the lives .
but there 's still a fourth number of land , and that 's a little important one .
and that 's the learning to learn .
if the only thing we can tell , is that it 's necessary , is the ability to learn and learn new to what 's going to learn to experience the evidence that we 're poor in the cities , and that our kids are poor in the
and that 's what you 've got to do , for a sudden , to school , to those
but where did i have ?
i was sitting in that position , and the kids who know that this is not just a most event for you to pay care of .
so , the state of the state of that was probably not from everybody .
until that 's where life gets left , then all of a sudden , you get all the way out of the way .
yeah , i was sitting there , and what i 'm saying is , in fact , the most one of my children were the most popular parts of the event .
less of them , it was as a dad when the whole sound of the time was to go out and learn the entire body system .
and even worse , it 's like a child 's child , because in school , you get it .
and finally , this competition , or was a member of this activity of the water in the school .
and it was n't a real life that it was so much like a difference , so it 's just the last news , and in fact , we were the only parents who had been asked .
and i 'm going to take you to you , and also , the most common of the most popular of the time is that we have to have our child a child 's child , which
but are the most two years where we 've been , there 's nothing like this .
so what do we do ?
and we actually had to ask ourselves , the question of our child ?
and are we the only ones that are so ?
now , i 've been in the last two years , since i 've been talking to a lot of people , and i 've seen , i 'm afraid , you 're not alone .
there are a lot of where there 's a lot of that , and that was just two years ago , so there i was just about to do a new company , and we talked about where the journey came there , and eventually we
and what i 'm saying , he almost the same story about one of his kids , he 's almost the same thing as we did , and we had the question that we could have been able to spend our kids out there from school , right ?
in berlin , there is a clear point in different schools , and we could even go into schools .
but can everyone be there ?
and somehow , we had to do this with a little , just our kids in security and to have the middle of the middle of the way they are .
and after we 've been now , we 've been looking at the fact , and we were n't there , we were really , we know , well , we 're the first ones to do this right now .
just how to change a competition we 're doing something ?
the good thing is we 've been on .
we 're not alone .
but we 've been very quickly , quickly , all of the series of great people that would like us to do , because to be a student who 's going to be great .
it 's not so that only kids and their parents have to be in the control of what 's going on there .
if we look at the teachers , we have 30 percent of the teachers who have lost .
when we look at how the number of the number of the world 's population has been worth in the last 10 years .
can it be that anybody 's wrong ?
that all children are being willing to be , and that the teachers are being their teacher ?
or , it 's going to be a business that 's just not going to be able to do so much like this , that it 's not going to be the case that we do n't just have the same thing
and we 've found a lot of people who were doing it , and we 've seen people who have no kids .
and they 've found that it 's responsibility for the future to take responsibility to the future by which we are in our children and the kids that are now going to be in school , with the way of the way .
and we 've been able to call ourselves to the second second , there 's a whole range of great devices that are going to change in school , and there 's a lot of the great schools , and there 's almost a lot of people who are really trying to be able to
and there 's even one or other , the first one , which is also going to be the first step .
and how do we want to help ?
we did n't have a sense of that , that we could be about to help .
but we can do one thing , we can go to the schools , and we can go to those schools to people who are in school , so the parents and the students , and we can see that in two days , all of us are
so there 's people together that there are so much more than the same amount of things , and the learning learning in two days , which it means to make people .
so , here 's the whole fundamental challenge that you have in common together .
and after two times , you 've been able to have a new system and a doctor 's , or the bus , for a completely new way , as we do in a medical school .
or they have the extraordinary consequences for most of the problems that they have in their school , has developed .
within two days , there are new ways that the next day can be going to be going to be going to go back
but what 's the most rule of this two days , and that makes it so much the little , i 'm going to have to do , then , to spend in schools , that energy , which is where there 's
when the three things together , this is what happens like `` raw times . ''
so , you think , and when you do a team , you know .
then this is a strange machine , which is called the solar cell .
and when we look at four weeks of this system , we then learn to see the school in the past , to change that there is an incredibly new culture .
and that 's incredibly profound .
and i 'm going to take a deeper way to think about school .
i 'm going to take you to think about school .
and i 'm not trying to teach you to do it , and i 'm going to talk about school .
talk about what you might like , but when you 're talking about what you do n't like .
you become going to be surprised how much of them you get , and how many people do n't have the same , but just talk .
let 's take them every single school to a hospital in germany to the top century .
let 's change the entire system .
and let 's do that with the people who are going to be 18 day for the parents , the teachers and the students .
because only in the other hand , we can do this .
thank you .
